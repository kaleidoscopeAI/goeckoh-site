\section{Simulation Frameworks and Implementation}

Developing and validating the cognitive architecture necessitates sophisticated simulation frameworks capable of modeling asynchronous, multi-component dynamical systems with discrete and continuous elements. Our architecture’s modular Thought Engines and curiosity-driven activation mechanisms require concurrency-friendly and high-performance simulation engines.

\subsection{Requirements}

Key requirements for the simulation system include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for asynchronous execution of independent cognitive modules.
    \item Management of state updates with event-driven scheduling.
    \item High concurrency and parallelism for scaling complex cognition.
    \item Introspection and visualization tools to monitor state trajectories, curiosity tension dynamics, and routing matrix evolution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rust-Based Simulation Frameworks}

Rust’s safety guarantees, efficient async runtime, and strong typing suit our needs. Notable frameworks include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NeXosim}: A highly optimized discrete-event simulator with transparent concurrency support designed for complex cyber-physical systems \cite{asynchronics_nexosim_2025}.
    \item \textbf{krABMaga}: A Rust-based agent-based modeling simulator supporting modular components and concurrency \cite{krabmaga}.
    \item Custom asynchronous modules leveraging \texttt{async-std} or \texttt{Tokio} runtimes for dedicated engine processing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation of Curiosity Tension Dynamics}

The curiosity tension scalar \(c_k\) is modeled dynamically using discrete-time updates incorporating uncertainty measures and reinforcement feedback:

\[
c_{k+1} = \max \bigl(0, \rho c_k + \alpha U(S_k) - \sigma Perf_k \bigr),
\]
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(U(S_k)\) quantifies the cognitive uncertainty at step \(k\),
    \item \(Perf_k\) captures knowledge acquisition effectiveness,
    \item \(\rho, \alpha, \sigma\) are tunable parameters controlling tension dynamics.
\end{itemize}

Simulations track \(c_k\) activating the web crawler Thought Engine when exceeding a threshold, triggering knowledge-seeking behavior probabilistically modeled via Brownian or Poisson processes to reflect real-world non-determinism.

\subsection{Example Simulation Algorithm}

\begin{verbatim}
Initialize S, c = 0

for k in range(max_steps):
    uncertainty = compute_uncertainty(S)
    performance = compute_performance_feedback()
    
    c = max(0, rho * c + alpha * uncertainty - sigma * performance)
    
    if c > threshold:
        I_crawl = O_crawl.process(c)
        S = update_global_state(S, I_crawl)
    else:
        S = update_global_state(S)
    
    log_state(S, c)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Integration with Reinforcement Learning}

Routing weights connecting Thought Engines are updated leveraging rewards computed as:

\[
r_k = U(S_{k-1}) - U(S_k),
\]
driving policy improvements targeted at maximizing uncertainty reduction.

The stochastic policy gradient methods implemented within the simulation ecosystem enable continual adaptation consistent with observed cognitive and environmental changes.
