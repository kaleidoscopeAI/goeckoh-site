\section{Introduction}

The pursuit of general intelligence in artificial systems has long mandated the union of fundamental cognitive processing, adaptive learning, and autonomous knowledge acquisition capabilities. This work presents a novel cognitive architecture grounded in rigorous mathematical guarantees, demonstrating stable and convergent processing via contraction theory while integrating an autonomous curiosity-driven web crawling engine to actively seek out and incorporate new knowledge.

Our approach unifies multiple cognitive Thought Engines including speculative reasoning, kaleidoscopic perspective generation, and large language model (LLM) reasoning, within a globally contracting dynamical system framework. The autonomous web crawler (`O_{crawl}`) acts upon internally generated curiosity signals, enabling open-world adaptation and real-time knowledge expansion.

We rigorously prove stability through contraction metrics and Lyapunov function extensions, develop Rust-based asynchronous implementations for efficient crawling and integration, and formalize reinforcement learning-driven routing adaptations informed by curiosity resolution feedback. This positions our architecture as a groundbreaking step toward scalable, robust general intelligence.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

\subsection{Contraction Mapping and Global Stability}

Let \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\) represent the global cognitive state space at discrete time \(k\), with state vector \(S_k \in S\). The system evolves according to a global operator:
\[
S_{k+1} = G(S_k, I_k),
\]
where \(I_k\) represents input embedding vectors received from Thought Engines or external sensors.

\begin{definition}[Contraction Mapping]
The operator \(G: S \to S\) is a contraction with constant \(\alpha \in (0,1)\) if:
\[
\| G(S) - G(S') \| \le \alpha \| S - S' \|, \quad \forall S, S' \in S.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Banach Fixed Point Theorem]
If \(G\) is contraction on complete metric space \((S, \|\cdot\|)\), then there exists a unique fixed point \(S^* \in S\) such that:
\[
G(S^*) = S^*,
\]
and for any initial state \(S_0\), the iterates \(S_k\) converge exponentially:
\[
\| S_k - S^* \| \le \alpha^k \| S_0 - S^* \|.
\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Infinitesimal Contraction and Jacobian Analysis}

For systems where \(G\) is differentiable, contraction can be examined locally through the Jacobian matrix:
\[
J(S) = \frac{\partial G}{\partial S}(S).
\]
If there exists \(c > 0\) such that for all \(S\), the matrix measure \(\mu(J(S)) \le -c\), then \(G\) is infinitesimally contracting. This condition ensures exponential decrease of perturbations and local stability which extends globally under suitable connectivity assumptions.

\subsection{Augmented System with Curiosity-Driven Web Crawling}

Inclusion of an autonomous web crawler introduces an augmented state vector:
\[
X_k = \begin{bmatrix} S_k \\ c_k \end{bmatrix},
\]
where \(c_k \ge 0\) denotes the curiosity tension level triggering web crawling actions.

The combined system evolves as:
\[
X_{k+1} = G_c(X_k) = \begin{bmatrix} G(S_k, I_k + I_{\text{crawl}}(c_k)) \\ h(c_k, \text{Perf}_k) \end{bmatrix},
\]
where \(I_{\text{crawl}}\) is the bounded, Lipschitz-continuous crawler output embedding, and
\[
c_{k+1} = \rho c_k - \sigma \text{Perf}_k,
\]
models curiosity tension dynamics with decay parameter \(\rho \in (0,1)\) and performance-driven reduction \(\sigma > 0\).

A suitable weighted norm can be defined:
\[
\|X\|_W = \|S\| + \gamma |c|,
\]
for some \(\gamma > 0\), and under reasonable assumptions on \(I_{\text{crawl}}\) and \(h\), \(G_c\) can be shown to be a contraction mapping. This guarantees stability and convergence of the entire system, including web crawling activation and autonomous knowledge acquisition.
