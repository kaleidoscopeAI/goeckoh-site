# Unified Cognitive AI System

## Overview

This is a fully integrated, unified cognitive AI system combining advanced bit-level cognition, transformer reasoning, emotional modeling, real-time device control, and rich visualization. The system is designed for CPU- and mobile-optimized deployment, running cognitive cycles that reflect on environmental context, hardware states, and external knowledge.
