Choose Your Descriptors: Carefully select the molecular descriptors that are most relevant to your research. Think about the properties you want to visualize and analyze.

Experiment with Dimensionality Reduction: Try both PCA and t-SNE and compare the results. t-SNE can be very powerful, but it can also distort global relationships in the data.

Implement Quantum-Inspired Similarity (Stage 2): We'll tackle the quantum-inspired similarity search in the next stage. This will involve researching and implementing a suitable quantum-inspired metric.

Dynamic Network Analysis and GNNs (Stage 3): This will be a more complex stage, as it requires setting up the dynamic graph structure and training GNNs. We'll address this after the similarity search.
