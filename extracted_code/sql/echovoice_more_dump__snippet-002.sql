• Learn Optimal Parameter Tuning: An RL agent can learn a policy for dynamically adjusting the parameters of other components (e.g., the (\theta, \mu, \sigma) of OU processes, learning rates in online algorithms) to maximize long-term performance based on observed outcomes.1 This automates the meta-optimization task.
• Learn High-Level Interpretation Strategies: The agent could learn to select among different analysis methods or focus mechanisms based on the current state and data context.
• Optimize Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing the need to explore new interpretations or data aspects versus exploiting the current best understanding.
