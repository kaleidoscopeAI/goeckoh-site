This approach will give you a more organic, time-lapse feel as each set of nodes “grows” out from the previous ones. When you run this code, you should see nodes gradually appear in real time, with each round of replication taking one second. This visualization gives a better sense of how nodes will grow step-by-step in the full model.

Try this out and let me know how it looks! It should give a closer experience to the vision of organic, time-based growth in the network.
