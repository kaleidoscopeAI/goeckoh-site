> > I'm now focusing on deriving 'Affective State' from the lattice dynamics. Valence will correlate with stability and symmetry within the lattice. Arousal will relate to the energy level and rate of change. I'm strategizing how to present the code clearly, explain the underlying physics based on Hamiltonian dynamics, and highlight the SIMD optimization facilitated by `nalgebra`. I also need to show the integration into `lib.rs`, effectively serving as the "glue" connecting the parts. Instead of per sample, the Lattice will update per audio buffer (chunk) to maintain speed.
