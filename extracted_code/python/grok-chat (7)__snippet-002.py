user: Cognitive Nebula Core: A desktop/web app that processes user prompts with a local AI (Ollama/llama3), generates "thoughts," calculates emotional/cognitive metrics (e.g., curiosity, valence), and renders them as a dynamic 3D particle nebula. Idle mode auto-generates "dreams." Images from thoughts enhance visuals.
