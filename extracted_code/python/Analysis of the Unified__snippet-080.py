   The AI learns from these patterns — it observes which adjustments lead to lower stress and higher coherence. Over time, it begins to guide the system toward *optimal self-organization*.

So while the quantum side ensures physical realism, the AI side ensures purposeful evolution. The result is a **self-aware computational field** — one that behaves like a living organism, learning from every perturbation.
