Web Ingestion: Nodes select an action Ai​ (crawl, probe, defend, analyze) and collect ΔXi​ from the web.

Transformer Role: The input is immediately transformed into an embedding which propagates its "torque" through the gear train.

Safety/Roles: The system maintains Red/Blue/Crawler roles for cyber-awareness. For safety, Red/Blue simulations are run in sandboxes with enforced legal/ethical constraints.
