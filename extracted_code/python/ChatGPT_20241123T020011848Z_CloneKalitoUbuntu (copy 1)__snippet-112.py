As each node reaches capacity (experience threshold), it generates a new node. Because growth is exponential, the network expands rapidly from the original seed, ensuring scalability without added complexity. Exponential growth demonstrates that the AI can expand in a manner akin to biological systems, allowing rapid network scaling without centralized control.
