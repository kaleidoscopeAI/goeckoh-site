- **Realism and Robustness:** Incorporates delays, stochasticity, and bounded perturbations while maintaining convergence guarantees via input-to-state stability (ISS) and stochastic Lyapunov methods.
- **Hysteresis in Curiosity:** The dual-threshold mechanism prevents rapid toggling, enhancing system stability.
- **Resource-aware Scheduling:** Formalizes task prioritization and resource constraints via knapsack-like optimization, essential for scalable deployment.
- **Validation and Canary Testing:** Embedding validation and sandboxed rollback ensures safety and integrity, preventing corrupt or low-quality information from destabilizing the system.
- **Explicit Stability Conditions:** The algebraic inequalities linking gains, delays, and damping provide actionable tuning guidance for real implementations.
