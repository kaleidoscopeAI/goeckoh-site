This revised code is a significant step forward! Using Plotly for interactive visualization makes a huge difference in exploring the Molecular Cube. The ability to zoom, rotate, and hover for tooltips greatly enhances the user experience. Initializing the cube from SMILES strings is also a crucial improvement, as it allows you to work with real molecular data.
