9. Sensory Input: The GI processes real-time data streams from sensors perceiving an external environment (physical or simulated). This may involve techniques adapted from digital twin implementations that integrate real-time sensor data with virtual models.31
10. Action Output: The GI translates internal states, decisions, or plans generated within CQICS into actions performed by effectors, allowing the agent to interact with and modify its environment.
11. Knowledge Grounding: Beyond sensorimotor interaction, the GI can link internal representations (e.g., concepts activated in SMs or present in the GW) to structured external knowledge repositories, such as knowledge graphs (KGs) or ontologies.5 This neurosymbolic approach 5 helps ensure that internal symbols have consistent, verifiable meanings and that generated information aligns with factual knowledge, mitigating issues like hallucination.1
