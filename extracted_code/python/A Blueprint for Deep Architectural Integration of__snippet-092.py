- **Curiosity bit** implements the discrete curiosity operator as a simple threshold gate on weighted float inputs (mapped from bits).
- **Routing and integration** use bitwise OR for signal aggregation, can be extended to AND, XOR, shifts, masking for feature-level control.
- **Input projection** is mask + shift operations on bitvectors.
- Approaches like this enable extremely **low-level, hardware-accelerated bitwise cognition** implementations, supporting fast and memory-efficient AI systems.
