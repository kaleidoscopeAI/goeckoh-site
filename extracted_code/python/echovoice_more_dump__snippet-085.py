The UNI system executes high-level cognitive intent through physical manipulation of the host machine. The ControlMapper translates abstract Intent Commands (e.g., 'increase_performance', 'conserve_energy') derived from the Collective Intelligence phase into precise sequences of Human Interface Device (HID) reports.1 The HIDController then sends these simulated HID reports (byte arrays for mouse movements, clicks, and key presses), allowing the AI to autonomously interact with the host operating system's graphical interface.1
