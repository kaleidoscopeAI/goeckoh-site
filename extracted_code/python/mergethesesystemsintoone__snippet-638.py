  "Description": "Data Ingestion, Multi-modal Input, Evolving Representation, Reasoning, Feedback, Dynamic Node Growth, Action Execution",
 "Details": {
    "Data Ingestion": "Raw data (text, images, numbers) are ingested, validated, then converted to appropriate structures through data wrappers, that make specific formats compatitble with each method.",
   "Multi-modal Input":"All data types text, images numerical, get handled and transformed into system representations ",
        "Evolving Representation":"The nodes continually adapt, by analyzing local data for trends withing context of current and prev data sources . the representations are enhanced and refined each time they update by adding insights. data.or context in relation to its specific internal state ",
       "Reasoning" : "Based on knowledge generated rules are created and applied to create new patterns from all new insights",
          "Feedback": "Insights then get returned into nodes through engine level interaction, allowing new knowledge and adaptations in both trait based and system processes to ensure correct operations . insights are combined and evaluated, creating future behaviours or directions to follow.",
   "Dynamic Node Growth": "Nodes replicate if certain conditions are met. they share data through interactions, strengthening relationships or creating new patterns .Nodes are monitored and pruned as needed if not performing their functions based on defined resources. they adjust their processing abilities based on experience, or adapt their states if there are resource constraints etc. based on set parameters or self directed behaviours."
     ,     "Action Execution":"Nodes execute on assigned actions if appropriate energy constraints are available ."
