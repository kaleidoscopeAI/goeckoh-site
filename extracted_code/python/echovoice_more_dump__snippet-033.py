This evaluation will systematically address the core components of the proposed plan: the selection of an appropriate LLM for CPU-based operation, the design of the unified 3D visualization system, the architecture of the integrated simulation pipeline, the strategy for state management and inter-process communication, the proposed modular code structure, and the approach to configuration management. The analysis incorporates findings from relevant technical documentation and benchmarks to provide context and support for the recommendations. The report culminates in a synthesized end-to-end integration plan, outlining actionable steps and highlighting areas requiring careful implementation and testing.
