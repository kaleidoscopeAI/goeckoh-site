While direct application might be complex, concepts from differential geometry, particularly geometric flows, can offer powerful analogies for the adaptive process. Ricci flow is a prime example.30 It is a partial differential equation that evolves a Riemannian metric (g) on a manifold (M) over time (t) according to the rule:
