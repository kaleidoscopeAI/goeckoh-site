    Dynamics: The state of each node (E) evolves based on internal decay, diffusion to neighbors (W @ self.E), and external stimulus (e.g., external_input derived from vocal arousal or task complexity).
    Output: This simulation produces emergent, high-level metrics, most notably the Global Coherence Level (GCL), a value (e.g., 0.0-1.0) representing the overall stability, harmony, or "flow state" of the user's modeled mind. A high GCL indicates focus and stability; a low GCL indicates stress, cognitive overload, or "meltdown risk."
