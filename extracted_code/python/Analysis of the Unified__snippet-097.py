    Bond Strength (Bij​): Measures the coherence of knowledge between nodes i and j, calculated from their Knowledge vectors (Ki​,Kj​) and normalized by their relative distance/proximity Xij​.

    Relational Weight (Wij​): The core weight used in the Hamiltonian, calculated based on the dot product of Awareness Vectors (Ψi​⋅Ψj​).
