A significant external challenge and risk factor is the ongoing controversy surrounding IIT itself. While IIT is a leading theory and a cornerstone of the CQICS framework, it has faced substantial criticism, with some scholars labeling it as unfalsifiable or pseudoscientific due to the difficulties in empirically testing its core tenets, particularly the Φ measure and its direct link to experience.6 Building a system heavily reliant on IIT's postulates means proceeding with awareness of this theoretical uncertainty. If IIT's fundamental claims are incorrect or untestable, the theoretical foundation of CQICS is weakened. This underscores the need to prioritize testable aspects of the framework (e.g., GWT-inspired functional dynamics, grounding mechanisms) and potentially explore or develop alternative or modified measures of integration alongside Φ approximations. The empirical results from building and testing CQICS could, in turn, contribute evidence relevant to the evaluation of IIT's core principles, but the risk associated with its contested status must be acknowledged.
