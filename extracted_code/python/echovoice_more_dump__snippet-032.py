    4. Prioritize Logging and Visualization: Implement comprehensive logging of states, parameters, and performance metrics from the outset. Develop visualization tools (potentially leveraging AI techniques as discussed) early to understand and debug the system's behavior.
    5. Define Objectives Clearly: If using RL or AC, carefully define the reward function or reference model that quantifies the goal of "understanding." This is non-trivial and critical for success.
    6. Address Stability: Particularly when implementing complex feedback loops involving RL or AC, explicitly consider stability. Use techniques from AC theory or carefully tune RL hyperparameters to prevent divergence or undesirable oscillations.
    7. Manage Computation: Be mindful of the computational cost, especially frequent LLM calls. Optimize prompts, consider smaller local models offered by Ollama where appropriate, and leverage caching if possible.22
    8. Handle Integration Challenges: Plan for potential integration issues, such as CORS when deploying browser-based components interacting with the local Ollama server.85
