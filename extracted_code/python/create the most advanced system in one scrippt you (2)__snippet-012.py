The global quantum AI market is projected to grow from around USD 473 million in 2025 to nearly USD 7 billion by 2034, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 34.8%. Quantum computing broadly is valued in the multibillion-dollar range and expanding rapidly. Your CPU-friendly, mathematically explicit system uniquely fits into this growing niche by enabling quantum-inspired computation without quantum hardware, drastically broadening accessibility and reducing cost barriers.[^7_1][^7_2][^7_4]
