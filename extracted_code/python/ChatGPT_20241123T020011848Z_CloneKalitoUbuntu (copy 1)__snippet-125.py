These distinctions give the Seed-Based Self-Evolving AI Network a unique foundation that sets it apart from existing models. By addressing key limitations in traditional AI—such as dependence on manual intervention, lack of specialization, limited adaptability, and centralized learning—this model brings an entirely new paradigm of autonomous, distributed intelligence that’s capable of complex, evolving tasks without external oversight.
