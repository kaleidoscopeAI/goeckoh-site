Decision-making in UNI is filtered through the Quantum-Inspired Optimizer (QIO), which integrates affective history into the optimization process.1 QIO receives learning insights (embedded decision vectors) and modulates them by retrieving the emotional context associated with similar past experiences from the memory crystal.1
The QIO averages the valences associated with retrieved memories.1 A predominantly positive average valence from the context history introduces a positive bias, scaling the resultant decision vector (e.g., by 1.1) to reinforce the action.1 Conversely, a negative bias would trigger conservation intent, leading to cautious behavior ('conserve_energy').1 This mechanism implements a robust model of affective decision-making, confirming that the system’s actions are not purely rational but are powerfully gated by past emotional experience, prioritizing long-term well-being and avoidance of historically negative contexts.
