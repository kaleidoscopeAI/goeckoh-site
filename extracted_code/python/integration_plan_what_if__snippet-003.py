*   **Audio Input:** Child's speech (microphone) and ambient sounds.
*   **Preprocessing:** VAD (Voice Activity Detection), Noise Reduction, RMS/Prosody Extraction (pitch, energy).
*   **Emotion Quantification:** Initial real-time arousal/valence derived from audio features (EchoVoice's Crystalline Heart).
*   **Text Transcription:** Speech-to-Text (Whisper).
*   **Environmental Data (Crystal AI Enhancement):** Input from external sensors (e.g., light, temperature, presence, child's physiological data via wearables) processed by Crystal AI's backend.
