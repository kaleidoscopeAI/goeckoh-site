"This is the Goeckoh mirror in action. 

Watch: [Speak steady phrase] → bubble smooths, glows blue → *high coherence, positive valence*
[Sharp 't-k-s'] → spikes texture → *low coherence, high arousal*
[Breathy whisper] → roughens, shrinks → *low energy, disrupted periodicity*

It's not judging. It's reflecting the physics of your voice in real time—helping notice and regulate without words."

**Key close**: "The Rust core computes deterministic lattice states from 5 voice physics features. Sub-200ms browser latency proves the edge deployment."
