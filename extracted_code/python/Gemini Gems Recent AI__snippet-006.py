    Intelligent Data Streaming Architecture: A multi-layered system for ingesting, fusing, validating, and semantically enhancing data from various sources (PubChem, ChEMBL, RCSB PDB, Open Molecules 2025). This emphasizes data integration and intelligence.

    Dynamic Node Evolution System: Details on how molecular nodes are structured (Identity, Property, Interaction, Evolution Engine layers) and their lifecycle (Birth, Growth, Validation, Refinement, Maturity). Also, how nodes interact through binding prediction, ADMET modeling, side effect prediction, and efficacy scoring.

    Dynamic 3D Visualization Engine: A compelling vision for a real-time, interactive molecular theater where molecules "grow and change color," "pulse/breathe," and show connections and heat maps. It also proposes adaptive representation at quantum, molecular, cellular, and organism levels.

    AI-Powered Drug Discovery Workflow: A conversational example demonstrating how a query like "Find compounds similar to aspirin but safer for the stomach" would lead to data streaming, protein structure queries, 3D visualization, and simulation of molecular interactions.

    Competitive Advantages: Highlights real-time intelligence, conversational discovery, visual understanding, predictive accuracy, and scalable architecture as key differentiators. The ultimate "game-changer" is that the system discovers drugs through intelligent simulation, rather than just searching.
