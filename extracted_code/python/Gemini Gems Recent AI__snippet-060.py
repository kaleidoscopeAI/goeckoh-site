    Problem: Interpreting the Molecular Cube can still be challenging. Users need tools to help them extract meaningful insights from the data.

    Novel Approach: Integrate AI-driven insight generation. Use machine learning models to analyze the data in the cube and automatically identify interesting patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Develop an interactive exploration interface that allows users to ask questions of the AI and get explanations for its findings. This could involve natural language processing and visualization techniques to present complex information in an understandable way.
