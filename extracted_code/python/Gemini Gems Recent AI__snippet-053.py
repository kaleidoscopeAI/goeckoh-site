    Novel Approach: Implement dynamic network analysis. The graph should evolve over time, reflecting changes in molecular properties, interactions, and relationships. Explore Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of molecules and their interactions directly from the graph structure. GNNs can be used for tasks like predicting binding affinities, identifying potential drug targets, and even generating new molecules with desired properties.
