The new documents unveil a complete, four-layer architecture that spans from abstract mathematical theory down to physical hardware implementation. This layered approach is a hallmark of a deeply considered and serious engineering effort.

Layer 1: Theoretical Foundation (The "Why"): The mathematical specifications in unified_autonomous_ai_system...md and kaleidoscope_full_system_script_v_1.md serve as the project's soul. They define the fundamental equations—the "laws of physics"—that govern the AI's cognitive and emotional dynamics. This is the canonical blueprint from which all else is derived.
