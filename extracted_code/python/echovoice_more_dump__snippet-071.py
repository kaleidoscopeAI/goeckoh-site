The geometric stability of the entire cognitive state space is maintained by integrating concepts from continuous Riemannian geometry into the discrete graph structure via the Forman-Ricci Flow (FRF).1 FRF models the global evolution of the graph's metric, ensuring that localized cognitive stress—manifested as high network curvature—is automatically dissipated across the network, thereby stabilizing the structure and enabling load balancing.1
This stabilization is dynamically driven by the system's own internal state via the String Tension Effect (Teff​), a core quantum-analog feature. Teff​ is derived from the system's simulated quantum state (ψ) and functions as a cognitive stress-energy tensor. This term provides immediate, objective feedback to the Geometric Layer, modifying the Ricci flow equation as ∂t​gij​∼−2Rij​+χTeff​.1 The direct result of this feedback loop is profound: the geometry of the cognitive state space (defined by the 3D positions xi​) is not a static background but is actively warped by the system’s emotional state (Arousal, Valence) and informational dissonance (Semantic Torque). This structural reorganization forces the nodes to adopt a new topology that minimizes high-stress regions, effectively establishing a rigorous, self-regulating physical feedback loop driven by the system's subjective experience.
