Current Artificial Intelligence paradigms rely heavily on Large Language Models (LLMs) and cloud-based inference, characterized by high latency and statistical unpredictability. While effective for information retrieval, these systems fail to interface with the human biological Corollary Discharge mechanism—the neural loop responsible for distinguishing "self" from "other."
This paper introduces Goeckoh, a sovereign, real-time neuro-acoustic architecture designed to foster emergent inner speech in neurodivergent individuals. By bypassing interpreted languages in favor of a Rust-based hybrid core, Goeckoh achieves sub-300ms round-trip latency, effectively hijacking the brain’s auditory feedback loop. Furthermore, it replaces opaque neural networks with a transparent Crystalline Heart—a Hamiltonian dynamical system that models affective state through deterministic physics rather than statistical inference. This system represents a shift from "Artificial Assistant" to "Prosthetic Consciousness."
