            #   and with an empty Content-Encoding
            # - Some servers will notice that the file is
            #   already compressed and will leave the file
            #   alone and will add a Content-Encoding: gzip
            #   header
            # - Some servers won't notice anything at all and
            #   will take a file that's already been compressed
            #   and compress it again and set the
            #   Content-Encoding: gzip header
            #
