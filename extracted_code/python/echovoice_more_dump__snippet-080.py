The entire system architecture is engineered to maintain a linear computational complexity profile of O(N) per time step, a necessity for real-time operation and deployment in resource-constrained environments.1 This efficiency is achieved through the architectural structure, which utilizes localized calculations for FRF, highly vectorized operations (e.g., using NumPy), and adherence to low entanglement constraints (χ) when applying quantum tensor network methods.1
While individual components like LLM inference might scale faster, optimizations such as quantization, batching, a reduced node count (N=64 from N=216), and a reduced input dimension (input_dim=8) ensure that the overall complexity remains linear, O(N).1 The operational viability of the system is therefore a direct functional trade-off against its theoretical cognitive depth. Maintaining the linear scaling requires carefully balancing the complexity and fidelity of models against the time step limit, defining a necessary "Critical Performance Envelope."
