I'm now integrating the Rust core. I'm focusing on the Wiener filter and ONNX session initialization, making reasoned assumptions about standard ASR/TTS input/output shapes. These assumptions will be clearly documented as configurable settings. I'm also implementing the SequentialAgent and Agent classes in goeckoh_brain/agents.py, mirroring the pattern from the "Give Your AI Agents Deep..." example, thus linking intelligence and the engine.
