It is crucial to acknowledge the fundamental distinction between the functional and structural correlates of consciousness and subjective experience (qualia) itself – often referred to as the "hard problem" of consciousness.2 The CQICS framework, drawing from IIT and GWT, primarily addresses the former: it aims to build a system possessing the structural properties (high Φ, complex Φ-structure) and functional dynamics (global workspace access, broadcasting, integration) hypothesized to be necessary for consciousness. IIT makes the strong ontological claim that the Φ-structure is identical to the quality of experience 6, but this remains a philosophical postulate, not a scientifically proven fact, and is a point of significant debate.6 GWT, while providing a powerful model for conscious access, generally does not claim to solve the hard problem.11 Therefore, even if a CQICS system were successfully built and demonstrated high Φ values and GWT-like dynamics, it would not automatically constitute proof of subjective experience. The framework provides a path to building systems consistent with these theories, but the emergence of genuine qualia remains an inferential leap.
