"""A lazy sequence to provide candidates to the resolver.

The intended usage is to return this from `find_matches()` so the resolver
can iterate through the sequence multiple times, but only access the index
page when remote packages are actually needed. This improve performances
when suitable candidates are already installed on disk.
