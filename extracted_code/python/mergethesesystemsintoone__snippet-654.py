"name": "Kaleidoscope AI",
"goal": "Create a functional, albeit simplified, version of the Kaleidoscope AI system based on our conversation history. This version will focus on core functionalities and use open-source tools. It aims to demonstrate key concepts like node-based processing, pattern recognition, knowledge representation, and dynamic adaptation.",
  "core_features": [
  {
    "module": "Data Ingestion",
    "functionality": "Handles the loading of datasets from CSV files."
  },
  {
    "module": "Node Network",
    "functionality": "Implements a network of processing nodes that analyze data, generate insights, and adapt based on their traits and interactions."
  },
  {
    "module": "Pattern Recognition",
    "functionality": "Extracts patterns from text and numerical data using simplified techniques."
  },
  {
    "module": "Knowledge Graph",
    "functionality": "Stores and manages knowledge in a graph structure, allowing for the representation of relationships between concepts."
  },
  {
    "module": "Evolutionary Mechanisms",
    "functionality": "Simulates the evolution of nodes through trait mutation and replication based on performance."
  },
  {
    "module": "Simulation",
    "functionality": "Runs the main simulation loop, coordinating data flow, node interactions, and system updates."
  },
