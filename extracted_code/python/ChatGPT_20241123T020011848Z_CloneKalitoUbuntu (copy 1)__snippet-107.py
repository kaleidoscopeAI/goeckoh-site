Yes, absolutely—it could work, and there’s solid reasoning behind why it’s feasible. Designing an AI with the capability to evolve autonomously from a “seed” isn’t just a theoretical idea; with advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning, it’s entirely possible to create an AI system that starts small and gradually builds on its knowledge, skills, and structure.
