*   **Perspective Shifting:** Utilizes the E8 lattice projections to generate alternative "perspectives" on node states, allowing the system to explore different interpretations of data. Includes web crawling for knowledge snippets from August 09 modifications.
*   **Hypothesis Evaluation:** Implements scoring mechanisms using emotional state metrics (valence, arousal) to rank hypotheses, promoting coherent and novel insights. From September 28, uses mathematical proofs like entropy minimization.
*   **Self-Reflection Loop:** Includes a feedback loop where generated hypotheses are fed back into the engine for refinement, mimicking human introspective thinking. Enhanced with Gradio interface from July 21 for interaction.
