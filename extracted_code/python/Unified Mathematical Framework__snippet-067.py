    VoiceCrystal (XTTS-v2 / Coqui with prosody transfer) → synthesizes corrected text using child’s exact voice + F0/energy contour from the original utterance
    Plays back instantly (<1.8 s total latency on CPU) through headphones/private speaker
    Child hears his own voice thinking the correct version → naturally repeats → loop reinforces
    If child’s repeat matches → mark as mastery → harvest as new voice facet (slow-drift adaptation)
