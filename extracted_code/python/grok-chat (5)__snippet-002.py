  - Total unique equations: 128 (after deduplication from ~200 raw entries; structured into layers for system completeness).
This forms a production-ready, unified framework: equations are now fully defined, typed, and interlinked for implementation (e.g., in Python with NumPy/PyTorch). Layers organize by function (Atomic, Dynamics, etc.), with cross-references.
