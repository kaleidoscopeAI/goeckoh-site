        ◦ Perform holistic evaluations focusing not just on task performance but explicitly on metrics derived from the underlying theories. This includes the best available Φ approximations and analyses of the Φ-structure complexity from the CSA, alongside GWT-related metrics quantifying workspace dynamics, broadcast effectiveness, and functional integration [Insight 3.5.1].
        ◦ Analyze the emergent dynamics of the complete system over extended periods. Look for patterns, phase transitions, or stable states that might correlate with theoretical predictions (e.g., does the system spontaneously transition between states of high and low estimated Φ? Do states with high Φ correspond to periods of stable, globally coherent activity in the GW?).
        ◦ Conduct computational "lesion studies," analogous to methods in neuroscience.6 Systematically disable or degrade specific components (e.g., the CSA, the MC, specific SMs, grounding connections) and observe the impact on both task performance and the theoretical metrics (Φ proxies, workspace dynamics). This helps understand the functional contribution of each component to the overall system properties.
        ◦ Based on the evaluation results and the comparison with theoretical predictions, iteratively refine the CQICS architecture, the algorithms used within components (e.g., trying different TN methods, Φ approximations, attention mechanisms), and system parameters. This phase involves continuous cycles of testing, analysis, and modification. Explore alternative mathematical tools or theoretical variations if current approaches prove insufficient.
    • Evaluation: Compare quantitative metrics against theoretical benchmarks or predictions. Analyze the results of lesion studies to validate component functions. Assess the system's robustness, adaptability, and the richness of its emergent behaviors. Critically evaluate the extent to which the system exhibits properties consistent with the integrated structural (IIT) and functional dynamic (GWT) characteristics targeted by the CQICS framework.
