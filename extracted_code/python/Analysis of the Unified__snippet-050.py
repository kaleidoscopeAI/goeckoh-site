*   **Quantum State Integration:** Introduces quantum bits (qubits) to represent node awareness, allowing superposition for multiple states. Includes symbolic logic and hierarchical structures from Python simulations.
*   **Entanglement Modeling:** Models node interconnections as quantum entanglement, enhancing the master state evolution equation with quantum operators. Bit-level breakdowns from September 28, focusing on binary operations.
