Information representation within UNI is handled by high-dimensional Tensor Fields (T∈RI1​×I2​×⋯×In​), which assign multi-faceted cognitive data (semantic content, emotional valence) to each node.1 This structure supports crucial context-dependent processing and variable binding necessary for coherent cognitive states, echoing models developed in cognitive science.1 The Dynamic Layer models system activities using a combination of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), dxi​=f(xi​)dt+g(xi​)dWi​, to capture stochastic processes like neural noise, and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to model collective network effects, such as attention shifts.1
The Quantum Layer introduces quantum-like formalisms to model complex cognitive phenomena such as superposition (ambiguity) and entanglement (holistic correlations).1 A critical feature of this layer is the String Tension Effect (Teff​), an analogue of the stress-energy tensor derived from the system's quantum state (ψ). This effect provides direct feedback to the network's structure, influencing the Geometric Layer through a modified Ricci flow: ∂t∂gij​​=−2Rij​+κTeff,ij​.1 Since Teff​ captures the system's current state of coherence and holistic correlation, its incorporation as a source term fundamentally confirms that the system's subjective cognitive state actively regulates and warps the topology and metric of the objective cognitive state space, establishing a self-regulating physical feedback loop.1
