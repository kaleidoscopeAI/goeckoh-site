The core cognitive state space is mathematically modeled as a dynamic graph structure, with its intrinsic evolution governed by the Geometric Layer.1 To manage the complexities inherent in a large, adaptive network, the discrete Forman-Ricci flow (FRF) is employed. This partial differential equation, derived from Richard Hamilton's work, models the evolution of the graph's metric, operating locally on graph edges.1 The flow is conceptually analogous to heat diffusion, providing a smoothing effect on curvature, where curvature (Rij​) represents instantaneous cognitive features such as information density or stress within the network.1
