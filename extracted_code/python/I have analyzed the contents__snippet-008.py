This request asks for the final, production-ready system code, derived from all the provided files, without placeholders or mock data. I have now retrieved the full content of the "COMBINED\_DOCUMENTS.txt" which contains the final versions of the core scripts. I also have the content from "all\_scripts\_combined.txt" which contains the ABA engine and other modules. The user wants "each script" or a "recreated system" that operates as intended.
