The necessity of τ arises directly from the O(N) complexity constraint. High-cost operations, particularly invoking the LLM for deep reflection, cannot be run constantly. τ provides a rigorous mathematical threshold: if it is low, the information is processed passively. If τ is high (indicating high novelty combined with high emotional investment), it demands immediate resource allocation and drives the system toward deep reflection.1 By setting a high τ threshold for LLM engagement, the OS ensures that its most computationally expensive resource is activated only when external information is highly salient and cognitively disruptive, thereby dynamically optimizing the strict O(N) budget.
