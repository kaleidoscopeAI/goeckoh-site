       * `kaleidoscope_core_py.py`: To provide the Python-to-C interface using ctypes.
   3. Main Simulation: I will create a main.py to initialize all components, run the main simulation loop, and
      demonstrate the core dynamics of the system, including data ingestion, annealing, crystallization, and
      speculative exploration.
   4. Dependencies: I will provide a requirements.txt file listing all necessary Python packages like numpy and
      networkx.

  The final result will be a runnable, CPU-optimized prototype of the UMAA, directly implementing the architecture
  from your document.

  Shall I proceed with the implementation?
