Zero prompts from the app. Ever.
No “say after me”, no flashcards, no lessons
Parent GUI exists for setup (record voice facets, add calming phrases, view metrics)
Child never sees or interacts with GUI
Runs silently in background from boot/power-on
One icon → starts forever (no CLI ever for family)
