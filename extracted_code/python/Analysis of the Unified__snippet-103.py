    SuperNode Formation: SuperNodes are built from collections of crystallized nodes, using networkx to build a simple graph for knowledge aggregation and to identify gaps (nodes with few connections).

    Pattern Alignment: The engine calculates a pattern_alignment_score (common patterns / total patterns) to determine how well nodes should merge.
