Copy the file below into your project as **`relational_hybrid_engine.py`** (it assumes `numpy` and the `relational_core_plus.py` / `krylov_evolver.py` environment from earlier are available, but it is self-contained enough to run on its own). After the file I explain in plain English what each part does and how to run the demo.
