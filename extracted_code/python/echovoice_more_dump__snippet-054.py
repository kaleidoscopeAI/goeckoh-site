        ◦ TN-Based Estimation: If the system state or Φ-structure is represented using TNs, algorithms for approximate TN contraction or entanglement measures calculated on the TN might serve as proxies for Φ.20
        ◦ Simplified Measures: Develop alternative metrics inspired by IIT's postulates (integration, exclusion, information) but designed for computational tractability, perhaps focusing on specific aspects of the cause-effect structure.
    • Workspace Dynamics Metrics: Define and track metrics reflecting the functional principles of GWT within the CQICS architecture.
        ◦ Information Flow/Broadcast: Measure the rate, diversity, and reach of information broadcast through the GW. How many SMs receive and are influenced by the broadcast content?
        ◦ Attentional Dynamics: Quantify the focus of attention (e.g., entropy over competing SMs) and the stability or flexibility of attentional shifts.
        ◦ Functional Integration: Develop measures based on information theory (e.g., transfer entropy, Granger causality) or causal analysis applied to the time series of SM activities, quantifying how effectively information broadcast via the GW integrates processing across different modules.
Potential Convergence of Metrics: An important area for investigation is the relationship between the structural integration metric of IIT (Φ) and the functional metrics derived from GWT dynamics. While Φ aims to capture an intrinsic property of the system's causal structure 6, GWT focuses on the functional consequences of information becoming globally accessible.10 It is conceivable that a system architecture like CQICS, designed to facilitate global information integration through broadcasting (GWT), might naturally tend towards states with high structural integration (Φ). If this hypothesis holds, then computationally tractable GWT-inspired metrics – such as the efficiency of broadcasting or the degree of system-wide coherence following a broadcast – might serve as reliable proxies for the computationally challenging Φ measure. Building and analyzing a CQICS system where both types of metrics can be estimated simultaneously would be crucial for testing this potential convergence and understanding the link between functional access and intrinsic structure.
