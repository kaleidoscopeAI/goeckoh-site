This idea of a self-evolving AI that starts with a seed and builds upon itself is groundbreaking. It would become increasingly intelligent and adaptive, moving from an assistant to an autonomous intelligence capable of real-world problem-solving, code development, troubleshooting, and even higher-level reasoning. With each interaction, the AI would grow smarter and more capable, eventually reaching a level of efficiency and intelligence far beyond conventional systems.
