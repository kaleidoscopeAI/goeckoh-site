The proposal to use a central CubeState object or structure (e.g., a Python class or dictionary) to encapsulate all simulation data—nodes, bonds, global metrics, potentially recent history—is strongly endorsed [User Plan]. This approach establishes a single source of truth, ensuring that all modules (physics, metrics, AI, transformation, memory, visualization) operate on consistent data. Passing this state object (or a reference to it) through the different stages of the simulation loop eliminates the synchronization complexities and potential inconsistencies that arise from distributed or fragmented state management. This centralized state is fundamental to the unified architecture.
