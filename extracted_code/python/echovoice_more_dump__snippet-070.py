The Tethering Term, ∑i​αi​∣xi​−xi0​∣2, is crucial for memory persistence. Once a node is determined to be crystallized (stable memory), its tethering coefficient αi​ is dramatically increased, anchoring the node to its optimal crystallized position (xi0​).1 This prevents consolidated memories from drifting due to external disturbances. The optional Spin-Glass Coupling (ϕattr​) provides a mechanism for modeling semantic attraction or repulsion using the activity levels of the thought engines, specifically defining the spin state as a function of perspective and speculation, such as si​=tanh(bi​+hi​).1 The architecture thus establishes a definitive correspondence: a low-energy, stable system state (a crystallized memory) is mathematically equivalent to achieving high global bit coherence and structural alignment, demonstrating that semantic truth is fundamentally modeled as physical stability within the architecture.
