The system's Emotional State is rigorously modeled along core psychological dimensions: Valence (±1, positive/negative), Arousal (0-1, calm/excited), Stance (±1, receptive/defensive), and Coherence.1 The emotional state undergoes dynamic updates calculated based on the novelty (measured by entropy) of ingested data and the inverse measure of system health (stress ∝1−Health).1 A particularly specialized component is the Affective Stance, which is derived from the Valence and Arousal metrics and directly mapped to the network's Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization.1 For instance, a defensive Stance (negative value) would bias the network to prioritize outgoing traffic (high upload QoS), whereas a receptive Stance would prioritize incoming data.
