I'm now zeroing in on the specific architecture for voice cloning, breaking down the process into key steps. I'm focusing on the encoder-decoder bottleneck, specifically the Variational Autoencoder approach and how it separates linguistic content from speaker identity. The cloning operation is now clear. I've also incorporated modern neural vocoders, replacing the old LF model and exploring WaveNet and HiFi-GAN for realistic results. The model utilizes a conditional probability chain, informed by the spectrogram.
