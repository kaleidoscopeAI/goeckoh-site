        ◦ Implement a simple Metacognitive Controller (MC) that receives feedback from the CSA (e.g., low estimated integration) and the GI (e.g., task failure, high prediction error). The MC should be able to exert basic control, such as biasing the attention mechanism or adjusting learning rates in SMs.
        ◦ Implement dynamic network adaptation, potentially using Ollivier-Ricci flow 14 to adjust connection weights between SMs or between SMs and the GW based on co-activation patterns or feedback signals.
        ◦ Define and measure initial GWT-related metrics, such as the number of SMs accessing the GW over time (attentional focus) or the correlation between GW content and subsequent activity in receiving SMs (broadcast effectiveness) [Insight 3.5.1].
    • Evaluation: Measure the implemented integration proxies and workspace dynamics metrics. Assess the effectiveness of the attention mechanism and the MC's ability to influence system behavior based on feedback. Analyze how Ricci flow dynamics alter the network structure over time.
