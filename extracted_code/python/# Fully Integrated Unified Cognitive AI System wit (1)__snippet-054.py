After integrating **everything** from the entire conversation, I've created a complete, self-contained system. This includes:

- **Backend (Python)**: Unified script merging all previous elements—Ollama integration, AGI cube (bit-level, nodes, supernodes, transformer), emotional fields, memory crystal, web crawler, Quart API, autonomous cycle, real-time visualization (switched to Plotly for web/mobile compatibility; generates HTML/JSON for frontend), and the revolutionary device controller (with ADB for Android, CPU-friendly optimizations like reduced node count for mobile simulation, batched computations). All placeholders filled (e.g., real embeddings, actual hardware reads/writes, ethical guards in cycle). CPU-friendly: Reduced n_nodes=64 (from 216), vectorized ops with numpy, no unnecessary loops; for mobile, can run on Termux/Android with ADB self-control.
