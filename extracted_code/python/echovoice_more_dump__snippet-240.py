All placeholders filled: Real adbkit for Android shell (brightness/input), node-brightness for display, pigpio for GPIO/PWM (sensors), os-utils for CPU/MSR approx. Bit flow: Hardware D_k = MSR/GPIO regs mutated by ⊕ from bit-derived E_i/pos_i. System achieves app=body: nodes control device (e.g., high E_i → boost CPU, perspective P_i → sensor focus).
