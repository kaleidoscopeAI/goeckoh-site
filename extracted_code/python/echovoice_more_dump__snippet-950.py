• Φ Approximation Techniques: Developing computationally tractable, yet theoretically sound, methods for approximating Φ and analyzing Φ-structures is crucial. This includes refining TN-based approaches, exploring graph-theoretic heuristics (like those based on Ricci curvature), and potentially developing entirely new mathematical frameworks.
• Alternative Mathematical Formalisms: Investigating other mathematical tools beyond those discussed (e.g., category theory, topological data analysis) that might offer novel ways to capture concepts of integration, structure, and dynamics relevant to consciousness.
• Refining CQICS Architecture: Iteratively refining the proposed architecture based on simulation results, theoretical analysis, and ongoing insights from neuroscience regarding brain connectivity, dynamics, and the neural correlates of consciousness.
• Learning and Development: Incorporating principles of learning and development into the CQICS framework. How does an integrated structure emerge over time through interaction and adaptation? How can the system learn to optimize its own integration or workspace dynamics?
• Comparative Analysis: Systematically comparing the properties and behaviors of CQICS systems with other advanced AI architectures (e.g., large-scale LLMs, other cognitive architectures like ITCM 39) using a common set of consciousness-relevant metrics and tasks.
• Enhanced Grounding Methods: Developing more sophisticated techniques for sensorimotor and knowledge grounding within the GI, ensuring robustness, adaptability, and semantic accuracy.
