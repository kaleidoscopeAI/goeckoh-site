continue after first looking over all documents and this conversation. no conceptual code and no place holders this system must be ready to ingest data from a user in a gui and produce ground breaking results eg drug discovery, stock prediction, molecular /chemical modeling. no gpu and if needed only use open source tools. this is to be a ground breaking ai. please continue

Okay, I understand. Let's focus on getting this AGI system ready to handle user data, produce groundbreaking results, all while using standard libraries that can run efficiently on a CPU (without external AI dependencies), in a functional system using only what has been made in this code thread.
