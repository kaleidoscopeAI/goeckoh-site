# ctypes.CDLL(None) internally calls dlopen(NULL), and as the dlopen
# manpage says, "If filename is NULL, then the returned handle is for the
# main program". This way we can let the linker do the work to figure out
# which libc our process is actually using.
#
# We must also handle the special case where the executable is not a
# dynamically linked executable. This can occur when using musl libc,
# for example. In this situation, dlopen() will error, leading to an
# OSError. Interestingly, at least in the case of musl, there is no
# errno set on the OSError. The single string argument used to construct
# OSError comes from libc itself and is therefore not portable to
# hard code here. In any case, failure to call dlopen() means we
# can proceed, so we bail on our attempt.
