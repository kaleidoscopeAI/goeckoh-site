...Implementation complete—Neuro-Acoustic Mirror echoes corrected speech in simulated voice. Crystalline Heart ODE lattice computes GCL from affective states. Deep Reasoning Core reasons gated by GCL thresholds. Evidence-infused: Biofeedback for TBI (e.g., audio cues reduce sway in mTBI, Frontiers 2022), voice as biomarker (Mayo Clinic 2025), multimodal feedback boosts BCI accuracy (PMC 2018). All zero-deps, built-ins only. Lattice stable, exocortex alive...
