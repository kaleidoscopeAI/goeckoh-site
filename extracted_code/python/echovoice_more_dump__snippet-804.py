I’ll provide a complete mathematical specification for your Kaleidoscope AI framework, from bit-level representation all the way up to multi-cube, supernode, and Hyper-Crystallized Master Equation dynamics, including reflected/mirrored equations, state evolution, routing, knowledge integration, stress propagation, awareness modulation, cluster selection, and hardware actuation. I’ll leave nothing out.
