My current focus is smoothing the transition between phonemes, particularly the creation of an interpolation engine for filter coefficients. I'm also planning to expose the "Voice Profile" points as global modulators. I've realized the impracticality of building a high-quality G2P converter from scratch, so I'll be using a simplified dictionary for the demo, which will rely on rigid mappings. Moreover, I'm now planning on incorporating a noise source for consonant sounds (fricatives and plosives).
