The computational efficiency stems from formulating all gradients and ODE updates as sums over the immediate neighborhood N(i) of each node.1 For instance, the calculation of the Position Gradient (∇xi​​H) and the coupling terms in the Thought Engine ODEs explicitly restrict computation to connected neighbors j∈N(i).1 If the graph is sparse—meaning the average node degree k is kept small—the time complexity for these operations remains O(N⋅k), which is asymptotically O(N). This inherent locality is the mathematical basis for the system’s high performance.
