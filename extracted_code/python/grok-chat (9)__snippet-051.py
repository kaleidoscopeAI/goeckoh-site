  shape from {sphere, cube, cone, torus, pyramid}, with specific overrides for
  common terms like dog/car/tree/etc. (cognitive-nebula/agi-thought-visualizer/
  App.tsx).

  If you’d like, I can render these shapes explicitly in the Three.js scene
  (using the metadata.shape already attached) so the visual difference is
  visible, not just stored.
