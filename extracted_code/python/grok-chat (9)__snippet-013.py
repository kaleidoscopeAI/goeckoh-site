    12 +- Neurocoherence Lattice (renamed from “Crystalline Heart”) now exposes
        a downsampled lattice profile and GCL history in `/status` for transpare
        ncy.

    15  - No empirical validation pipeline: no logged benchmarks for loop latenc
        y, N1/APE proxies, or inner-speech emergence metrics.
    15 -- Crystalline Heart is stubbed; no visible 1024-node ODE lattice outputs
         in the API or UI.
    16 +- Neurocoherence Lattice still simplified; no validated 1024-node ODE dy
        namics surfaced beyond downsampled profile.
    17  - Rust audio kernel (`audio_kernel/`) not wired into speech mirror; curr
        ent loop is pure Python + sounddevice.
