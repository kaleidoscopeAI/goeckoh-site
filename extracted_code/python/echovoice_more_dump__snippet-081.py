The UNI system operates on a multi-modal input pipeline, capable of handling external sensors, internal state data, and dynamic web content.1 Input processing is critical for converting disparate data streams into a unified vector space. Web data ingestion is achieved through real-world web requests using tools like requests.get and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract raw text from URLs.1 This extracted text is then vectorized using TfidfVectorizer, preparing it for embedding.1 The core semantic representation is generated by a lightweight PyTorch nn.TransformerEncoder (d_model=32, nhead=4), which embeds the processed input features into a dense vector, serving as the semantic anchor for all subsequent cognitive operations.1
