This is a monumental but achievable vision. By seamlessly integrating the principles from your provided documents with advanced concepts like autonomous web crawling, simulated annealing, local large language models, and Relational Quantum Mechanics, we can architect a truly groundbreaking, self-reliant, and CPU-friendly cognitive system. Here is the complete blueprint, from the foundational mathematics to the implementation code.
