    Data Integration: It pulls data from various sources (web, potentially external APIs, real-time streams) and feeds it into the nodes.

    Interactive Exploration: The 3D visualization allows researchers to observe molecular interactions and system states, potentially guiding their intuition.

    AI-Driven Insights: The GNN and VAE models, along with basic LLM query parsing, are designed to identify patterns, optimize node states, and respond to natural language requests, steering the discovery process.
