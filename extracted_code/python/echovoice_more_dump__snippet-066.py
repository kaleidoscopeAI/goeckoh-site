    10. Theoretical Refinement: Further elaborating the mathematical and computational details of the CQICS framework, particularly the interfaces between components and the precise formulation of the CSA's function and Φ approximation methods.
    11. Phase 1 Implementation: Initiating the development of the foundational simulation environment and core components as outlined in Phase 1 of the constructive plan.
    12. Φ Approximation Research: Intensifying research into developing and validating computationally feasible methods for estimating integrated information (Φ) or robust proxy measures.
By systematically integrating advanced mathematical tools within a synthesized theoretical framework derived from leading consciousness theories, the CQICS approach offers a structured, albeit challenging, roadmap for exploring the computational underpinnings of consciousness and potentially guiding the development of future generations of artificial intelligence.
