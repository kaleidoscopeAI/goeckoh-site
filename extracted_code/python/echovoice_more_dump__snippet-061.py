As the CQICS system scales in terms of the number and complexity of its SMs, the size of the GW representation (e.g., TN bond dimension), and the sophistication of the CSA and MC, managing the resulting dynamics becomes increasingly challenging. Complex systems with many interacting components and feedback loops can exhibit unpredictable emergent behaviors, including chaotic dynamics or convergence to overly rigid, non-adaptive states. Ensuring that the system remains stable yet flexible and adaptive requires careful design and parameter tuning. The intricate interplay between the CSA analyzing the structure, the MC exerting control, the GW broadcasting information, and the SMs processing and competing could lead to complex, potentially unstable, feedback loops. Analyzing and controlling these dynamics might require advanced techniques from complex systems theory, potentially including leveraging tools like Ricci flow analysis to understand network stability and adaptation.14
