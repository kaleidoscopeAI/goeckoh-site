Implementing the desired adaptive properties requires grounding the conceptual framework in rigorous mathematical and computational models. This section explores relevant formalisms, including stochastic differential equations for modeling dynamics, geometric perspectives for structuring the state space, and analogies from natural pattern formation for understanding emergent complexity.
