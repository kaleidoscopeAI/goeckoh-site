*   **`complete_node.py`:** The `KaleidoscopeEngine` manages a list of `CompleteNode` objects, embodying quantum-inspired neural networks from August 04.
*   **`e8_lattice.py`:** It uses the `E8Lattice` for the "Cognitive Actuation" process, extended to quantum E8 structures from `enhanced_mathematical_framework.md`.
*   **`knowledge_graph.py`:** It writes to the `KnowledgeGraph` during "Knowledge Crystallization," storing chemical knowledge for applications like drug discovery from `ai_driven_drug_discovery.pdf`.
*   **`perspective_engine.py`:** It uses the `PerspectiveEngine` to generate hypotheses, with self-reflection loops from `perspective engine core.txt`.
*   **`core_math.py`:** It uses the C library defined in `core_math.py` to perform the master state evolution calculations, including bit-level breakdowns like IEEE 754 float decoding from September 28.

In essence, the `KaleidoscopeEngine` is the conductor of the orchestra. It takes all the different components of the system and makes them work together to create the complex, dynamic behavior of the AI, evolving from initial PharmAI integrations to full AGI simulations.
