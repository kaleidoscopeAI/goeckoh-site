    • Topological Analysis: By computing Ricci curvature on this network using libraries such as GraphRicciCurvature 14 for Ollivier or simplified Forman curvature, or GeneralisedFormanRicci 15 for Forman curvature on simplicial complexes, the CSA can analyze the static topology of information flow. Edges with strong negative curvature might represent critical pathways whose disruption could significantly impact overall system integration (Φ) or hinder effective broadcasting from the GW. Conversely, regions with high positive curvature could correspond to tightly integrated SMs or functional units that form stable components of the system's cause-effect structure.
    • Dynamic Adaptation (Ricci Flow): Ricci flow is an iterative process that adjusts edge weights in a network to make the curvature more uniform.14 It tends to shrink positively curved edges (within clusters) and stretch negatively curved edges (bridges).18 In CQICS, Ricci flow (specifically the Ollivier-Ricci flow implemented in GraphRicciCurvature 14) can model the dynamic adaptation of connection strengths based on information flow patterns or learning rules governed by the MC. This could simulate Hebbian-like plasticity, strengthening connections within co-active modules (emerging complexes) and potentially weakening bottleneck connections if they impede efficient processing.
    • Community Detection: The metric derived from Ricci flow has been shown to be effective for community detection.14 The CSA or MC could use this property to dynamically identify emergent functional clusters within the CQICS network, corresponding to transient coalitions of SMs or the formation of stable sub-systems contributing to the overall Φ-structure.
