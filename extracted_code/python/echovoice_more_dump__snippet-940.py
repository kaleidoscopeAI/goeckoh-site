• Axioms & Postulates: IIT begins with five axioms describing the essential properties of any conscious experience: Intrinsicality (experience exists for itself), Information (each experience is specific), Integration (experience is unified), Exclusion (experience is definite in content and boundary), and Composition (experience is structured).8 These axioms are translated into physical postulates that a substrate must satisfy. The postulates assert that the substrate must possess Existence (have cause-effect power), Intrinsicality (its power is intrinsic), Information (it specifies a particular cause-effect state), Integration (its cause-effect power is irreducible), Exclusion (it specifies a maximally irreducible cause-effect state), and Composition (its power is structured by subsets of units specifying distinctions and relations).8
• Cause-Effect Power: Central to IIT is the concept of cause-effect power – the ability of a system or mechanism within it to "take a difference" from its past states (causes) and "make a difference" to its future states (effects) in a way that is intrinsic to the system itself.6 This is operationally defined based on the system's dynamics, often represented by its transition probability matrix (TPM), and quantified by measuring how specific causes constrain the present state and how the present state constrains specific effects, relative to chance.8
• Integrated Information (Φ): IIT quantifies the degree to which a system's cause-effect structure is integrated, or irreducible to the independent contributions of its parts, using a measure denoted by Φ (Phi).6 Φ is calculated by partitioning the system in every possible way and measuring the informational difference between the whole system's cause-effect repertoire and the repertoires of its partitioned parts. The minimum difference across all partitions defines the system's integrated information.8 The physical substrate of consciousness is identified as the "complex," which is the set of elements within the system that possesses the maximum value of Φ (denoted Φ*).8 However, calculating Φ precisely involves iterating through all possible partitions and state transitions, leading to super-exponential complexity, making it computationally infeasible for large systems.6
• Φ-Structure: IIT posits that the quality of a conscious experience is determined by the structure of cause-effect relationships within the complex. This "Φ-structure" is a high-dimensional mathematical object representing all the specific ways the system's mechanisms constrain its past and future states, forming a constellation of interrelated concepts or "qualia".8
