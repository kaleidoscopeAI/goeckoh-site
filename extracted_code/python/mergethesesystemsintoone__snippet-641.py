Task Persistence/Recovery: The current _load_tasks only loads completed/failed tasks and uses a dummy function (lambda: None). A more robust recovery system would need a way to re-associate the actual task functions (perhaps by storing function names or using a task registry) and potentially resume or reschedule tasks that were PENDING or RUNNING when the manager last shut down.
LLMProcessor Location: If this task manager is part of the larger "Rebuilt_AI_System_with_GPT" project, you might want to import the LLMProcessor from its module file (modules/LLMProcessor.py) instead of defining it again within this script, to avoid code duplication. If this script is standalone, then including it is fine.
Retry Logic: The Task dataclass has retry parameters, but the _run_task method in the scheduler doesn't currently implement the logic to retry failed tasks using retry_count, max_retries, and retry_delay.
Error Handling within Tasks: The analyze_code_task and summarize_code_task could benefit from internal try-except blocks to handle file reading errors more gracefully before the scheduler catches exceptions.
