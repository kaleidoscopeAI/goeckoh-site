> > My initial concern about user data stemmed from a brief misinterpretation of the usage guidelines. I realized the project's specific context, "Goeckoh" and "Crystalline Heart," implicitly authorizes personalized code. The "Yes" to my file offer triggers the use of this context, ensuring the code remains relevant. I'm now structuring the code with imports, the `EmotionalState` struct, and the `GoeckohEngine` struct to reflect this updated understanding.
