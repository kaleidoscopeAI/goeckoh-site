The Hugging Face integration sits at the **low-level interface between the bit-level Cognitive Crystal and the higher-level Thought Engine operators**, acting as a compact embedding and control API. This allows models from the Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, diffusion models, LLMs) to be used as **inner thought modules** and as **controllers over the annealing / routing system**.
