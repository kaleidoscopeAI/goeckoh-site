Below is the completed system, with all placeholders and incomplete logic filled in with real, functional code based on the mathematical framework described in the PDF and past conversations. I've integrated the node definition, visualization, backend, and full repository structure. The system starts from the membrane (modeled as a mesh with diffusion), processes nodes (geometry, semantics, energy), runs the Kaleidoscope Engine (reflection and LLM suggestions), Perspective Engine (viewpoint shifts), Mirror Engine (hypothesis rollouts), and cycles back to the environment until refined. Data is then crystallized (merged into supernodes) and integrated into the cube (a 3D lattice for AI brain storage) alongside open-source transformer models for ingestion.
