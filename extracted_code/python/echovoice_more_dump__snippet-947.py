• Goal: Increase the complexity and capacity of the system, enhance its grounding in external data/knowledge, and integrate more sophisticated mathematical tools.
• Tasks:
    ◦ Scale the system by increasing the number and functional diversity of SMs (e.g., adding modules for planning, episodic memory, more complex reasoning).
    ◦ Implement a more sophisticated GW representation capable of handling richer, higher-dimensional information. This is where Tensor Networks (TNs), such as PEPS-like structures 20, could be employed to represent the integrated state within the workspace.
    ◦ Integrate advanced TN algorithms into the CSA. Use techniques like Belief Propagation (BP) for approximate contraction 20 or BP gauging 22 to manage the TN representation of the system state or Φ-structure and potentially derive more robust estimates of integrated information.
    ◦ Significantly enhance the GI. Implement real-time data integration capabilities, allowing the agent to interact with dynamic external data sources (sensors, databases, APIs) using techniques demonstrated in digital twin frameworks.31 Incorporate neurosymbolic grounding mechanisms, linking GW contents or SM representations to entities and relations in an external Knowledge Graph (KG) to improve factual accuracy and interpretability.1
    ◦ Utilize more realistic simulation environments employing coupled PDE/SDE solvers 25 to model complex agent-environment interactions involving both continuous dynamics and stochasticity.
    ◦ Develop more sophisticated control strategies within the MC, allowing it to make more nuanced decisions based on integrated feedback from the CSA (refined Φ estimates, structural properties), the GI (environmental state, task progress, grounding consistency), and GWT metrics (workspace load, attentional stability).
• Evaluation: Assess performance on more complex tasks requiring integration across multiple SMs. Evaluate the quality of grounding (e.g., accuracy of linking internal states to KG entities). Measure the computational performance and accuracy of TN-based representations and Φ approximations. Analyze the stability and richness of the emergent dynamics in the scaled-up system.
