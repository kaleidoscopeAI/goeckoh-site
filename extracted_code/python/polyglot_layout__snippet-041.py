 Cross-language ensemble: every language’s AGI loop runs as a peer “organ” in the ring.
 Consensus cognition: the ring’s Φ is the robust median of all organs’ Φ per second.

 Time-series memory: every tick from every organ is stored; consensus is materialized for quick reads.

 Graceful ops: Ctrl+C triggers a group shutdown; crashed builds don’t stop the rest.
