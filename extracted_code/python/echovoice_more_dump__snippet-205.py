    PDF's knowledge K_i → derived from bit confidence (entropy or avg p_k) + engine states.
    PDF's perspective P_i → spec's b_i (perspective engine state).
    PDF's awareness A_i → derived from attention in engines + IIT Φ contribution.
    PDF's evolution (bonds, diffusion, mutation, LLM, replication) → spec's dynamics (Hamiltonian gradients, ODEs, Metropolis flips, birth/death).
    Emotional C_i modulates as in spec, influencing λ's and engines.
    Visualization: frontend updated with PDF's blueprint (data-rich spheres, dynamic bonds, overlays, aesthetics like bloom/glow, aurora gradients, particle auras).
    Groundbreaking aspect: Fuses physical (Hamiltonian dynamics), cognitive (thought engines), emotional (chemical flows), and quantum-inspired (decoherence/IIT) into a self-organizing AI OS for emergent reasoning—revolutionary for simulating "conscious" data refinement in drug discovery/AI brains.
