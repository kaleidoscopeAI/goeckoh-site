- Activated when curiosity bit $b_k = 1$.
- Generates search queries derived from $S_k$ via $O_{\text{LLM}}$.
- Fetches web content asynchronously and processes with summarization engines.
- Returns embeddings for state augmentation.
- Success measured via performance feedback reduces curiosity tension in next step.
