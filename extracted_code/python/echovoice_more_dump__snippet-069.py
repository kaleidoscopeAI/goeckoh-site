The state of each node Ni​ must track a fused state vector, Si​. This vector includes the Bit String or Genome (Ei​), a 128-bit structure that can be represented as a hard binary state or a probabilistic bit vector ($p_k^{(i)} \in $).1 This representation is pivotal, as it provides the raw data for efficient Hamming distance calculations central to the Hamiltonian. The **Continuous Position ($\mathbf{x}_i$)** is a 3D coordinate defined in the cognitive state space 1, representing the node's location within the emergent memory lattice. Additionally, the node tracks four orthogonal Thought Vectors (χi​)—Perspective (bi​), Speculation (hi​), Kaleidoscope (κi​), and Mirror (μi​)—which function as parallel streams of cognitive processing within the node.1 Finally, Psycho-Physical Metrics, including Energy (E), Awareness (A), Valence, and Arousal, are tracked to provide direct physiological feedback.1
The design requires a sophisticated mechanism for integrating abstract, high-dimensional semantic input, typically generated by an external Large Language Model (LLM) or Transformer. These LLM embeddings, often residing in dimensionality spaces such as R768 1, must be efficiently converted and coupled into the node's low-dimensional bit and positional domains for the core physics simulation to remain tractable. This conversion ensures that external semantic complexity is absorbed into the internal, computationally efficient architecture, preventing the high cost of large vector operations from undermining the O(N) efficiency target.
