    Prosody transfer mandatory (pitch contour, rhythm, energy from original utterance preserved)
    First-person always for corrective echo (“I want juice” never “You said I want juice”)
    Dynamic style switching via BehaviorMonitor:
    ─ high_energy → excited coach voice
    ─ anxious/meltdown risk → calm inner voice
    ─ success streak ≥3 → excited reinforcement
    Slow-drift adaptation: every 10 successes → re-sample best recent attempts → phase out old facets
    Fallback if no samples yet: use parent-recorded base facets or lightest possible generic child voice until first samples collected
