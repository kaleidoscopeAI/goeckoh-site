The emphasis on nonstationarity is crucial. A system aiming for deep, adaptive understanding must not only learn from new data but also adapt to fundamental shifts in the patterns, concepts, or context underlying that data. Algorithms focusing on dynamic regret and adaptive parameter tuning are thus better aligned with the goal of robust, ongoing adaptation than simpler online methods assuming a static world.
