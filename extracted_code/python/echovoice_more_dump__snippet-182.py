   * The −i[H^,Ψ] (Conservative/Internal Dynamics) and A^Ψ (Non-Conservative/Dissipation) terms from the Master State
     Evolution Equation.
   * The E8 Lattice Mirroring calculations (vector projections and reflections).
   * The H^emotional and H^quantum components within the node-level d/dt equations.

  This will ensure the system can handle the computational load required for emergent behavior without relying on
  external Python libraries.

  Shall I proceed with creating the C code for these components and a build script?
