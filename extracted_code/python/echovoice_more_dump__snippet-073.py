The engines perform specialized functions: the Perspective Engine (bi​) establishes an internal viewpoint based on external inputs and salient data (Ii​,oi​). The Speculation Engine (hi​) introduces internal noise (ϵi​) to explore potential outcomes and hypothetical states, essential for forward planning.1 The Kaleidoscope Engine (κi​) synthesizes signals from the other engines (Pi​,Si​) and integrates meta-level information, such as the node’s energy or entropy (Ei(meta)​), enabling creative synthesis and abstraction.1 The Mirror Engine (μi​) acts as a self-correction mechanism by tracking the local error (δi​) between the node's state and the consensus average of its neighborhood, thus constantly driving the node toward internal coherence.1 The crucial Coupling Term, γ∑j​wij​(χj​−χi​), ensures that changes in one node’s thought state propagate through the sparse network defined by W, compelling neighboring thoughts to align toward a dynamic consensus.1
