    VisualInputProcessor: Integrates with OpenCV (cv2) to potentially process video input (from a webcam or file). In the current implementation, it can detect simple "visual anomalies" to generate insights.

    WebSocketClient: Allows the system to receive real-time data or commands from an external WebSocket server.

    QueryParser: A basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) component that can parse simple user queries like "Find compounds similar to aspirin but safer for the stomach," identifying target SMILES and molecular property constraints.
