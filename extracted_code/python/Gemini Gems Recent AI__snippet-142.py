3D Library Integration (Three.js/Babylon.js): Choose a powerful 3D library (Three.js is a popular choice). You'll need to learn how to use this library to create the 3D cube visualization, handle user interactions (clicks, hovers, etc.), and efficiently render large datasets.

Data Fetching and Handling: Use JavaScript's fetch API or a library like Axios to make requests to your backend API to retrieve molecular data, similarity results, etc. You'll need to handle the data returned from the API and update the 3D visualization accordingly.

User Interface (React/Vue/Angular): Use a modern JavaScript framework (like React, Vue, or Angular) to build a user-friendly and interactive interface for your Molecular Cube. This will make your application much easier to maintain and extend.

State Management (Redux/Vuex): If you use a JavaScript framework, you'll likely need a state management library to manage the complex state of your application.

UI/UX Design: Pay attention to the user interface and user experience. Design your application to be intuitive and easy to use.

Testing: Write unit and integration tests for your frontend code as well.
