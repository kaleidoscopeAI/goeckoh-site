• Specialized Modules (SMs): Parallel, unconscious processors for specific tasks (e.g., sensory processing, memory).
• Global Workspace (GW): A limited-capacity hub for broadcasting information from SMs across the system.
• Causal Structure Analyzer (CSA): Analyzes causal interactions to estimate Φ and identify integrated structures.
• Grounding Interface (GI): Connects the system to the external world, ensuring meaningful interaction.
• Metacognitive Controller (MC): Provides high-level oversight and control, adjusting system dynamics.
