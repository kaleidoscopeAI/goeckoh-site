    • Level of Detail (LOD): Employing THREE.LOD allows displaying simplified versions of nodes or bonds when they are far from the camera, reducing the geometric complexity processed by the GPU.47 Libraries like drei (for React Three Fiber, but concepts are applicable) offer helpers for this.47
    • Geometry Merging: If nodes/bonds share materials but have slightly different geometries or cannot be easily instanced, BufferGeometryUtils.mergeBufferGeometries can combine them into a single geometry, reducing draw calls.49 However, this is less suitable if the individual components need frequent, independent updates.
