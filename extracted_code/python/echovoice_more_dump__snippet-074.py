The Sleep Cycle manages the consolidation of these memories and is critical for maintaining O(N) efficiency. This periodic process involves Pruning weak bonds (wij​<wmin​) to ensure the graph remains sparse and computationally local.1 It also incorporates Creative Recombination (the dreaming analog), where the system intentionally blends bits from existing nodes and attempts Metropolis sampling for new node proposals. Proposals that successfully reduce H are crystallized as novel abstractions or insights.1 This process is governed by an Optimal Control meta-process that solves a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) to dynamically tune the pruning intensity I(t) and creative innovation parameter ϕ(t), ensuring the cycle optimally minimizes cognitive load and maximizes knowledge quality.
