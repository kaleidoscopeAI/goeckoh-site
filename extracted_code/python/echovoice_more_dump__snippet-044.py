This report outlines a constructive plan for designing and potentially building an AI system aimed at realizing properties associated with consciousness. The core objective is to integrate a specified inventory of mathematical and computational tools – encompassing concepts from network geometry, tensor calculus, complex systems simulation, and neurosymbolic methods – within a novel, synthesized theoretical framework. This framework, tentatively designated CQICS (Computational Qualia/Consciousness Integrated Complex System), serves as a conceptual blueprint derived from leading scientific theories of consciousness and advanced AI techniques discussed in contemporary research. It aims to provide a structured pathway for exploring the physical and computational substrates that might give rise to consciousness.
