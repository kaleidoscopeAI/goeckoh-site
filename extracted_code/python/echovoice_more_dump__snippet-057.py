        ◦ Significantly enhance the GI. Implement real-time data integration capabilities, allowing the agent to interact with dynamic external data sources (sensors, databases, APIs) using techniques demonstrated in digital twin frameworks.31 Incorporate neurosymbolic grounding mechanisms, linking GW contents or SM representations to entities and relations in an external Knowledge Graph (KG) to improve factual accuracy and interpretability.1
        ◦ Utilize more realistic simulation environments employing coupled PDE/SDE solvers 25 to model complex agent-environment interactions involving both continuous dynamics and stochasticity.
        ◦ Develop more sophisticated control strategies within the MC, allowing it to make more nuanced decisions based on integrated feedback from the CSA (refined Φ estimates, structural properties), the GI (environmental state, task progress, grounding consistency), and GWT metrics (workspace load, attentional stability).
    • Evaluation: Assess performance on more complex tasks requiring integration across multiple SMs. Evaluate the quality of grounding (e.g., accuracy of linking internal states to KG entities). Measure the computational performance and accuracy of TN-based representations and Φ approximations. Analyze the stability and richness of the emergent dynamics in the scaled-up system.
