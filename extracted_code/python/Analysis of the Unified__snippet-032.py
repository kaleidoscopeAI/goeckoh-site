*   **Master State Vector (`Psi`):** The engine combines the states of all nodes (their energy, awareness, knowledge, and position) into a single "Master State Vector." The evolution of this vector is governed by a "Master State Evolution Equation," which is calculated using a C library for performance. Integrated from September 09 fusions, this includes quantum and learning components: \(\Psi_{t+1} = \Psi_t + \Delta\Psi\), where \(\Delta\Psi\) incorporates hierarchical neural networks and symbolic logic.
*   **Cognitive Actuation (`C^`):** This is a key process where a node's state is projected onto an 8-dimensional E8 lattice. This creates a "Kaleidoscope force" that influences the node's position and its "emotional state" (valence and arousal). Enhanced from October 08 with neuromorphic computing for adaptive tuning using spiking neural networks.
