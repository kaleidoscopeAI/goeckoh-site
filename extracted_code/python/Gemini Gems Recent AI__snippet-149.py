3D Visualization (Three.js): I can provide a more complete example of integrating Three.js to render molecules in 3D. This would include loading molecular structures (e.g., from PDB files or generated from SMILES), basic 3D manipulation (rotation, zoom), and potentially some simple interactions.

More Advanced Similarity Calculation: If you want to stick with similarity calculation for now, I can refine the quantum-inspired similarity example with a slightly more sophisticated "quantum-like" approach (though still simulated on a classical computer). Or we can explore other classical similarity measures.

Asynchronous Tasks (Celery - Simplified): I can provide a simplified example of using Celery to handle a time-consuming task (like similarity calculation) asynchronously. This would involve setting up Celery and a worker process.

Database Interaction (SQLAlchemy - Basic): I can give you a basic example of using SQLAlchemy to interact with a database (e.g., SQLite) to store and retrieve molecular data.

Combining Components: Once you have some individual components working, we can start to combine them. For example, we could combine the 3D visualization with the similarity calculation to display similar molecules in the 3D cube.
