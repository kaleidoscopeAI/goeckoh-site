    doc="""Special typing form used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
    type guard function.  ``TypeGuard`` only accepts a single type argument.
    At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean.

    ``TypeGuard`` aims to benefit *type narrowing* -- a technique used by static
    type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
    program's code flow.  Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
    conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code.  The
    conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a "type guard".

    Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
    as a type guard.  Such a function should use ``TypeGuard[...]`` as its
    return type to alert static type checkers to this intention.

    Using  ``-> TypeGuard`` tells the static type checker that for a given
    function:

    1. The return value is a boolean.
    2. If the return value is ``True``, the type of its argument
    is the type inside ``TypeGuard``.

    For example::

        def is_str(val: Union[str, float]):
            # "isinstance" type guard
            if isinstance(val, str):
                # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``str``
                ...
            else:
                # Else, type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``float``.
                ...

    Strict type narrowing is not enforced -- ``TypeB`` need not be a narrower
    form of ``TypeA`` (it can even be a wider form) and this may lead to
    type-unsafe results.  The main reason is to allow for things like
    narrowing ``List[object]`` to ``List[str]`` even though the latter is not
    a subtype of the former, since ``List`` is invariant.  The responsibility of
    writing type-safe type guards is left to the user.

    ``TypeGuard`` also works with type variables.  For more information, see
    PEP 647 (User-Defined Type Guards).
