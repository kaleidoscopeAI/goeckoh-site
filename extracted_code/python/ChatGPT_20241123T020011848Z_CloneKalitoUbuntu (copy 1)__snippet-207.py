do you also recall how we are handling the resources and 'waste' data etc? or how we are sharing resources aka information from one to another in order to limit the use of outside resources . or even how about the way it communicates. each node to the other or how the first node hits its threshhold then creates the next node with the building block information ingrained into it. or how it is supposed to begin it journey ( atleast in testing phases) throught wicki web crawling ( the titanic metaphor) im not sure i like the idea of the nodes dying it seems like a wasste of information. we need to fortifie so they dont die. thats silly thats lost information or brain pwoer the ai has. its not a living thing its better. it doesnt have to die
