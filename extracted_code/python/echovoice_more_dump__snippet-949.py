• Φ Calculation: The most prominent computational hurdle stems directly from IIT. Calculating integrated information (Φ) exactly involves evaluating cause-effect repertoires across all possible partitions of a system, a task whose complexity grows super-exponentially with system size.6 This makes exact calculation infeasible for any system approaching the complexity envisioned for CQICS. Consequently, the development and validation of accurate and efficient approximation methods for Φ are paramount. While heuristics based on Ricci curvature [Insight 3.2.1] or approximations derived from Tensor Network representations 20 offer potential avenues, their faithfulness to the full Φ measure remains an open question requiring rigorous investigation. The success of the CSA component hinges on overcoming this complexity barrier.
• Complex System Simulation: Simulating the CQICS system itself, especially when interacting with a realistic environment, poses significant computational demands. This involves managing a large number of interacting SMs, potentially represented by complex models like deep neural networks or TNs, coupled with the dynamics of the GW, CSA, MC, and a potentially complex environment model (possibly involving coupled PDEs and SDEs 25). Achieving real-time or near-real-time simulation for development, testing, and potential deployment may require high-performance computing resources, potentially including specialized hardware like TPUs, which have shown promise in accelerating large-scale scientific computations, including TN methods like DMRG.24
