- A `Visualizer` class directly implements the 3D embedding logic from the
  React frontend.
- It takes the AI's textual "thought" and transforms it into a set of 3D
  coordinates for a particle cloud, simulating the emergent "thought-form."
- Instead of rendering, it reports descriptive statistics of the visual state.
