    TypeGuard = _TypeGuardForm(
        'TypeGuard',
        doc="""Special typing form used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
        type guard function.  ``TypeGuard`` only accepts a single type argument.
        At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean.

        ``TypeGuard`` aims to benefit *type narrowing* -- a technique used by static
        type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
        program's code flow.  Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
        conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code.  The
        conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a "type guard".

        Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
        as a type guard.  Such a function should use ``TypeGuard[...]`` as its
        return type to alert static type checkers to this intention.

        Using  ``-> TypeGuard`` tells the static type checker that for a given
        function:

        1. The return value is a boolean.
        2. If the return value is ``True``, the type of its argument
        is the type inside ``TypeGuard``.

        For example::

            def is_str(val: Union[str, float]):
                # "isinstance" type guard
                if isinstance(val, str):
                    # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``str``
                    ...
                else:
                    # Else, type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``float``.
                    ...

        Strict type narrowing is not enforced -- ``TypeB`` need not be a narrower
        form of ``TypeA`` (it can even be a wider form) and this may lead to
        type-unsafe results.  The main reason is to allow for things like
        narrowing ``List[object]`` to ``List[str]`` even though the latter is not
        a subtype of the former, since ``List`` is invariant.  The responsibility of
        writing type-safe type guards is left to the user.

        ``TypeGuard`` also works with type variables.  For more information, see
        PEP 647 (User-Defined Type Guards).
