The report proceeds as follows: Section 2 details the synthesis of the CQICS framework, merging principles from IIT and GWT and outlining its proposed architecture. Section 3 elaborates on how specific mathematical tools from the inventory can be integrated within CQICS components and processes. Section 4 presents a phased, constructive implementation plan for building a CQICS-based system. Section 5 discusses anticipated challenges, including computational complexity, the nature of qualia, scalability, grounding, and ethical considerations, alongside future research directions. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks on the potential impact and next steps for this theoretically grounded approach to AI consciousness research.
