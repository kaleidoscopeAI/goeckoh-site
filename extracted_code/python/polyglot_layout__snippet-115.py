 Captioner: keep STFT→band-features→attention → id-weighted summary from local memory. (Already implemented.)

 Reflection: deterministic template + heuristic adjust. If Ollama is present, it enhances but is not required.
 Ingest: prefer local files (/state/corpus) and saved docs; only hit the network when explicitly allowed.
