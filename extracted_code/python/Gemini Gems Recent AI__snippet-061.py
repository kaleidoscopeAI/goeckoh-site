    Novel Approach: Explore biomimicry and chem-mimicry inspired algorithms. Draw inspiration from biological processes like evolution, self-organization, and swarm intelligence to develop new algorithms for molecular analysis and design. For example, you could use genetic algorithms to evolve molecules with improved binding affinities or use swarm intelligence to explore the chemical space represented by the cube.
