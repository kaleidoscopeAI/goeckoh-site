To ensure a smooth, scalable real-time launch, here’s a plan focused on structuring the code to run autonomously from a single node. This includes building in a sequential, growth-oriented approach that reduces “shock” by allowing the node to evolve and take on tasks gradually. I’ll break it down into three parts:
