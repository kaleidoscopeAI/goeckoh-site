The methodology employed involves a synthesis of core principles drawn from two prominent theories of consciousness: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT). IIT provides a mathematical framework for quantifying the necessary structural properties of a physical system capable of supporting consciousness, focusing on intrinsic cause-effect power and integrated information.6 GWT offers a functional architecture describing how information might be globally accessed, broadcast, and utilized within a cognitive system, linking information availability to conscious awareness.10
The CQICS framework aims to unify these perspectives by integrating IIT's structural requirements with GWT's dynamic information processing mechanisms. This synthesis is augmented by incorporating advanced mathematical tools, such as discrete Ricci curvature for analyzing network topology 14, tensor networks for representing complex states and structures 20, and numerical methods for simulating complex, potentially stochastic, dynamics.25 Furthermore, principles from complex systems simulation, digital twins, and neurosymbolic AI are leveraged to address the critical issues of grounding, real-time interaction, and knowledge integration.1
