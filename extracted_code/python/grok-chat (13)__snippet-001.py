I'm now finalizing the framework for the "map." Layer 3 will focus on the vertical elevation, essentially charting the registers from the lowest to the highest pitches. I'm also preparing Layer 4, which will deal with the texture and nuance of the voice, including timbre and the role of formants in shaping vocal sound. This will complete the data structure and prepare the visualization.
