*   **Emotional Modulation:** The core idea is that the "emotional state" of a node (its valence, arousal, and coherence) can influence the output of the LLM. This is achieved through an `EmotionalAttention` mechanism that generates attention weights based on the emotional context. Quantum-integrated from recent enhancements, using simulated superposition for multiple state explorations.
*   **Crystalline Knowledge Base:** The `EmotionalTransformer` is connected to a `CrystallineKnowledgeBase`. This knowledge base is "recalled" during the transformer's forward pass, and the retrieved knowledge is integrated into the final output. This suggests a tight coupling between the symbolic knowledge graph and the sub-symbolic LLM, merged with Cognitive Crystal AGI from September 28.
*   **Emotional Fine-Tuning:** The file includes a placeholder for "emotional fine-tuning." This suggests that the system is designed to learn and adapt based on "emotional feedback," which could be a powerful mechanism for self-improvement. CPU-friendly with Ollama from October 12, replacing Gemini dependencies.
