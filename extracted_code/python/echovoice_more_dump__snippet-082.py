The system integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) via real HTTP requests to the Ollama API, providing the system's "inner voice" capability.1 The LLM performs contextual reflection by receiving a prompt constructed dynamically using the calculated Semantic Torque, the current average emotional state, and relevant memory contexts retrieved from the memory crystal.1
The LLM's primary function is not merely linguistic output; it is instrumental in Recursive Self-Modeling.1 The reflection provides the symbolic interpretation of the system's state, and this linguistic output is instantly analyzed or re-embedded to calculate new adaptive parameters (such as cooling rates or mutation rates).1 This process allows the system to reflect upon its own performance, adjust its internal strategies (Strategyt+1​), and modify its goal set (Goalt+1​) based on the analysis.1 The LLM, therefore, serves as the system's Adaptive Self-Programming Engine, facilitating meta-learning by generating actionable, strategic adjustments derived from narrative self-analysis.
