*   **`complete_system_state.py`:** The `CompleteAdaptiveResonanceSystem` holds a `CompleteSystemState` object, which in turn contains all the other components of the system (the nodes, the `KaleidoscopeEngine`, etc.). The `global_update` method of the `CompleteSystemState` is where the actual work of the simulation is done, including quantum substrate and node embodiment from August 04.

While the file is named "Adaptive Resonance System," it doesn't seem to implement the ART algorithm directly. Instead, it appears to use the term in a broader sense to describe the overall process of the system settling into a stable, "resonant" state. The ART-like behavior is likely an emergent property of the interactions between the various components, enhanced by chaos swarm optimization from October 08.
