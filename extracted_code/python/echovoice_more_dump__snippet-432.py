quantum mechanics into meaningful, high-level cognition—moving from K (Knowledge/Coherence) to RP (Conceptual Space). This service is the system's "interpreter," telling
us what the system is learning and how that learning is structured. 1. The Mathematical Core: Projection The function of the service is to take the entire set of Knowledge
Observables (Ki​) from the 5,000 nodes and compress it into a few meaningful, persistent points in a conceptual space. The Input Source: The nodes array provided by
