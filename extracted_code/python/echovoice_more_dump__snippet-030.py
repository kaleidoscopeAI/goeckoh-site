        ◦ Geometric Analogies: Ricci flow provides a metaphor for the system intrinsically "smoothing" its internal state (metric) by reducing "curvature" (inconsistency, complexity) towards a more uniform understanding.30 Phyllotaxis and the Vogel spiral suggest using principles of irrational distribution (Golden Angle) for robust exploration and representation within the state space.37
    3. Implementation Algorithms: Practical algorithms realize the adaptation:
        ◦ Online Learning: Algorithms designed for nonstationary environments enable continuous updates based on sequential data, tracking dynamic changes.50
        ◦ Reinforcement Learning (RL): DRL learns complex, goal-directed policies for adjusting parameters or interpretation strategies within the high-dimensional Cube, optimizing a reward signal related to "understanding".5
        ◦ Adaptive Control (AC): Principles from AC provide tools for ensuring the stability and convergence of the adaptive feedback loops, potentially combined with RL (AC-RL).6
    4. Ollama Integration: Locally run LLMs, accessed via the Ollama REST API (/api/generate, /api/chat, /api/embeddings) 3, are integrated into the loop to provide:
        ◦ Guidance for parameter tuning.
        ◦ Semantic interpretation of system states.
        ◦ Generation of test scenarios.
        ◦ Tool use for external interactions.70
