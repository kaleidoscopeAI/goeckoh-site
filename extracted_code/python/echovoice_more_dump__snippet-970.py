N-body from tools: From YouTube/code blog (calculate_force with x/y components), p5 examples (forces/orbits), editor sketches (orbit/n-body) – added real gravity force in client (acc += Gm1m2/r^2 * unit vec), orbit stability via initial vel.
Aurora from tools: From Claude blog/YouTube (sin wave transparent gradients), p5 tutorials (lerpColor) – implemented multi-layer sin(t + y*phase) lerp blue-green-purple, alpha for glow.
Halo glow from snippets: From deconbatch (blendMode(ADD) for addition colors), OpenProcessing (blend() offset fix, but WEBGL uses ADD), GeeksforGeeks (blend two pixels) – added blendMode(ADD) with multiple semi-trans stroke spheres for layered glow.
