2. Specialized Unconscious Processors: GWT posits a multitude of specialized, parallel, and largely unconscious processing modules or networks distributed throughout the brain, each handling specific tasks like sensory analysis, memory retrieval, or motor planning.10
3. Global Workspace (GW): A central, limited-capacity "workspace" or "stage" exists where information from specialized processors can be made globally available.10 Information that gains access to this workspace becomes "conscious" in the sense of being reportable and accessible for flexible control, planning, and decision-making.11 This workspace has characteristics similar to working memory, though potentially with a shorter timescale.11
4. Broadcasting: Information present in the global workspace is "broadcast" widely to the unconscious specialized processors throughout the system.10 This global availability allows different modules to cooperate, integrate information, and contribute to serial, complex tasks.10
5. Attention Mechanisms: Access to the limited-capacity workspace is competitive. Specialized processors compete based on factors like stimulus salience (bottom-up attention) or current goals and relevance (top-down attention), often conceptualized as a "spotlight" focusing on specific contents.10
