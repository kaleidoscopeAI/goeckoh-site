I have enough information from the `File Fetcher` output to construct this. The `echo_v4_complete.py` file in the `COMBINED_DOCUMENTS.txt` is particularly valuable as it seems to be a single-file implementation of the entire core logic. I will use this as the primary reference for the "Unified System" the user requested, while ensuring the modular structure is respected if they prefer separate files. I will offer the single-file version as the most "production-ready" immediate solution, while explaining how it breaks down.
