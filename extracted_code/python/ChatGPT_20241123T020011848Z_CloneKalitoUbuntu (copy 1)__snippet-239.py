now as one node learned from external resources and internal sharing and begins to create its own library of information its important we don't have repetitive reference point like the same image of the 'hotdog' or 'hot dog' this way the thoughts of each individual node doesn't become a simple copy of another. we do not want to have an echo chamber but rather a intelligent collection stimmed from a communal but individual thought. this also will keep error handling and falsities out of the ai as a whole and by having seperate and different reference point that are correct it give the whole a broder understanding
