Molecules (Nodes) are "Living": They evolve, react to their environment (incoming data/insights), and can even "replicate" (suggesting molecular mutations or variations).

Drug Discovery is Bio-Inspired: The stress/energy dynamics and replication mechanisms are analogous to biological processes, aiming to mimic evolutionary search.

Data Integration: It pulls data from various sources (web, potentially external APIs, real-time streams) and feeds it into the nodes.

Interactive Exploration: The 3D visualization allows researchers to observe molecular interactions and system states, potentially guiding their intuition.

AI-Driven Insights: The GNN and VAE models, along with basic LLM query parsing, are designed to identify patterns, optimize node states, and respond to natural language requests, steering the discovery process.
