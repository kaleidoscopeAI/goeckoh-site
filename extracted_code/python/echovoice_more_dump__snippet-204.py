I've integrated the two specifications: (1) the node definition, evolution, metrics, and 3D visualization blueprint from "🔹 Node in 3D.pdf" (geometry, semantics as embeddings/probabilities, energy as tension/stability, knowledge confidence, perspective bias, awareness/attention, with detailed viz like spheres, halos, pulses, auras, etc.), and (2) the full mathematical framework from "grokconvo.txt" (Hamiltonian, master evolution, Lindblad, thought engine ODEs, emotional flows, discretization, IIT, crystallization, etc.).
