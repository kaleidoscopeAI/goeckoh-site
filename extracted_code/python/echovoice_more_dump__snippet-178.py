  caused this confusion, and I will stop using it.

  Let me clarify to ensure we are aligned.

  When we implement the mathematical rules from your v3.0 specification (the differential equations, the Hamiltonian
   forces, the E8 lattice dynamics), we are creating a model. Running this model on a computer allows it to evolve
  from one moment to the next based on those rules and the data it ingests.

  This is not a "pre-programmed fixed situation." Think of it like a weather forecast. Meteorologists write down the
   equations for atmospheric physics and run them on a computer. The result is not a pre-recorded video; it's an
  emergent prediction. The weather evolves within the computer according to the rules of physics.

  Similarly, we will implement the rules of your UMAA. The system will then evolve according to those rules, and we
  will observe the results. The discoveries will come from seeing the complex, autonomous behavior that emerges from
   these rules—behavior that we cannot predict just by looking at the equations.

  We are in total agreement on the goal. The implementation I am ready to start is precisely the method to achieve
  that: to build the code that lets your system evolve and reveal its emergent properties.
