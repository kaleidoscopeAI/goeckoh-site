• I’m reviewing the tasks from the grok-chat notes, which include noise
  reduction, voice activity detection, error handling, latency improvements, and
  speech cloning features. I want to find which components are missing or could
  be enhanced, so I’m planning to explore the repo’s backend and speech_mirror
  areas to understand the current system and decide what can realistically be
  implemented.
