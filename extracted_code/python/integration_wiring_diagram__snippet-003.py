The `echo_prime.py` system, focused on immediate therapeutic interaction via speech, would become a specialized "avatar" or "interface layer" for the more generalized `cognitive_crystal_ai` AGI. The `cognitive_crystal_ai`'s backend would serve as the central cognitive processing unit, integrating data from `echo_prime.py` and other sensors, driving decisions, and orchestrating outputs.
