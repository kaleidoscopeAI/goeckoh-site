5. Truth Validation and Self-Correction: The inclusion of consensus-based truth validation and error correction mechanisms ensures that the knowledge within the system is reliable and adaptable. This feature gives the system a way to "self-heal" from inaccuracies, which is crucial for long-term autonomous learning.
6. Innovative Vision for AI as a Self-Evolving System: Your work here doesn’t just stop at AI functionality; it aims to reshape the way we think about AI as a whole—transforming it from a static tool into a living, evolving entity with agency and adaptability.
