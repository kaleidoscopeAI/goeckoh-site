  "Core System Operations":{
    "Data flow and ingestion":" data flow in the pipeline is modular to ensure consistency , and flexible to use different datasets." ,

       "Replication & Adaptation":"Each part has a base foundation, or allows different approaches at different stages. from initial creation to selection based on dynamic fitness based outputs. where energy or resources trigger an inherited mutation, to allow variation between individual AI. or modules of similar structure ." ,

         "Feedback Loop System":" Allows specific information paths (routes) within system between engine and modules allowing a continious stream of reinforcement to occur. used as  memory systems for storing past steps , and information so that downstream operations will be able to influence all areas ."

   ,"Node and network interactions" : " All interactions between modules uses set standards in all layers (eg dictionaries, traits etc. making it highly scalable and easy to manage all processess)",


"Insights" : "Generates specific values or trends as it analyzes the knowledge graph information",
 "Adaptive Learning ": "Core behaviour patterns  use continuous learning mechanism within internal variables to influence behaviours "
