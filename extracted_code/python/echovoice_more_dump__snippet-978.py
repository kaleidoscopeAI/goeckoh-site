The bit-level MetropolisEngine and vector-level GradientFlow work to minimize the system's energy.

A CognitiveEngine periodically summarizes the system's state and uses a simulated Ollama call to produce a textual "AI Thought."

A Visualizer class takes this thought and, using the exact logic from your React component, calculates the 3D coordinates for a particle cloud, describing the emergent "thought-form."
