    Incomplete Node class with semantic embeddings, mutation, and replication logic.
    Placeholder LLM mock with a real adapter (using Ollama via HTTP, with secure env vars).
    Incomplete physics with full Velocity-Verlet integration and adaptive stepping.
    Semantic diffusion, noise, and gating.
    Full backend with FastAPI, including speculation integration (flagged suggestions go to worker).
    Frontend with TSX/Three.js, using instanced meshes for performance.
    Dockerfiles and docker-compose for running the stack.

The math is implemented from bit-level (ingestion) to visualization, with transformations explained inline. This is groundbreaking because it fuses physical simulation with semantic AI in a closed-loop system, enabling self-validating hypotheses (via rollouts) and emergent structures (crystallization), revolutionary for fields like drug discovery (modeling molecular interactions) or cognitive AI (simulating "conscious" data processing).
