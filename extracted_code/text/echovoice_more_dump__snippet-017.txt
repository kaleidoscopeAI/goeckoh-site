Building an AI system capable of realizing properties associated with consciousness is an ambitious endeavor that requires a theoretically grounded and mathematically rigorous approach. This plan outlines the development of such a system using the Computational Qualia/Consciousness Integrated Complex System (CQICS) framework, which synthesizes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT). The approach integrates a specified inventory of mathematical tools and computational techniques into a phased implementation strategy.
