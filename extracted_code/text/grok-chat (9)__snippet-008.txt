    transcript/corrected text into NodeTargets on the client using a golden-
    angle spread and a concise color palette. Phrases like “dog chasing car”
    immediately spawn corresponding thought nodes. (File: cognitive-nebula/agi-
    thought-visualizer/App.tsx)
  - Dashboard wording already switched to “Activation” (no further copy changes
    needed).
  - Rust heart snapshot is exposed via /status and shown on the dashboard;
    mirror heart state flows through /mirror/metrics.

  Next actionable steps

  1. Run the mirror to generate telemetry, then validate latency:
      - python scripts/measure_loop_latency.py (hardware loopback)
      - python scripts/validate_mirror_metrics.py
  2. Surface the Rust lattice profile visually on the dashboard (side-by-side
     with Python lattice) for parity.
  3. If you want richer visual semantics, I can add a small keyword→geometry/
     material map so “car” spawns a chassis shape, “dog” a warm particle
     cluster, etc.
