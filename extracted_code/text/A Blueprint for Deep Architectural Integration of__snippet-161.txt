- Transformers wrapped via `llama.cpp` in Rust.
- Input encoded/decoded as bit vectors or embeddings quantized to binary approximations.
- Web crawler triggered when $b_k = 1$, asynchronously fetching, summarizing, and embedding new info as bit vectors.
- Outputs clipped and quantized to preserve system Lipschitz contractions.
