"""Construct a packaging.Requirement object with caching"""
# Parsing requirement strings is expensive, and is also expected to happen
# with a low diversity of different arguments (at least relative the number
# constructed). This method adds a cache to requirement object creation to
# minimize repeated parsing of the same string to construct equivalent
# Requirement objects.
