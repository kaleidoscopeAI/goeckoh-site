Yes, I’m making headway on refining the node adaptation and memory functions to better capture the adaptive learning you’re aiming for. I’m expanding the `OrganicCore` class to handle more sophisticated experience-based adaptations, allowing each node to dynamically evolve its traits based on specific interactions.
