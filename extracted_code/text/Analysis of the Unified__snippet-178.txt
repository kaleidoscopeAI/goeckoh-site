Resources: The environment tracks resources and provides them to nodes, recording usage in a history queue.

Replication/Removal: Nodes replicate if they meet an internal criteria (energy surplus) and are removed if their energy depletes to zero.

SuperNode Creation: Nodes with high knowledge crystallize. When sufficient Nodes merge, they form a SuperNode that builds a simple networkx graph to identify knowledge gaps and generate placeholder tasks.
