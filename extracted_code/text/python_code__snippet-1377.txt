Convert a Name metadata value to a .egg-link name, by applying
the same substitution as pkg_resources's safe_name function.
Note: we cannot use canonicalize_name because it has a different logic.

We also look for the raw name (without normalization) as setuptools 69 changed
the way it names .egg-link files (https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4167).
