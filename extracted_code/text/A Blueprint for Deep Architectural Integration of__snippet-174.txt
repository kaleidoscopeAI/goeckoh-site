- **Incremental Development:** Begin with simulation of core curiosity-driven cognitive loops under controlled noise and delay, validating stability numerically before full web integration.
- **Theoretical Fortification:** Develop extended stochastic, delay-inclusive stability proofs tailored to your architecture.
- **Modular Safety Layers:** Construct layered security and resource management frameworks before deployment on open Internet data.
- **Performance Engineering:** Profile bottlenecks early, apply model compression techniques, optimize thread-safe concurrency patterns, and embrace asynchronous distributed processing.
