   * The coefficients for the internal state evolution (eD, kD, muAE, lambdaE, etc.) in umaa/node.py are
     currently hardcoded constants. The v3.0 specification mentions these could be "dynamically tuned or
     learned."
   * Improvement: Make these coefficients dynamic, allowing them to change based on the node's internal states
     (E, A, K), emotional vector (epsilon), or the global Psi state. This would introduce a layer of
     self-adaptation.
