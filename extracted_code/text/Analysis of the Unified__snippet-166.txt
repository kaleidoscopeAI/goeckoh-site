Crystallization: When a node's knowledge surpasses a threshold, its information is "crystallized" into a KnowledgeGraph. This process explicitly includes a step for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) redaction.

Hypothesis Generation: The engine periodically uses the PerspectiveEngine to generate and evaluate hypotheses for each node as a form of speculative reasoning.

Pattern Alignment: The system calculates a pattern_alignment_score between nodes to determine how well their patterns align.
