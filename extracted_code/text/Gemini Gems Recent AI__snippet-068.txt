Problem: PCA, while useful, still projects high-dimensional data into 3D, losing information. Visualizing relationships in truly high-dimensional space is challenging.

Novel Approach: Explore techniques like t-SNE or UMAP for dimensionality reduction, which often preserve local structures better than PCA. Even more cutting-edge is exploring hyperdimensional visualization directly, using techniques like parallel coordinate plots, radial coordinates, or even virtual reality/augmented reality interfaces to represent and interact with data in more than 3 dimensions. This allows for richer exploration of molecular feature space.
