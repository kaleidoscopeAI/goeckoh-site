   * The umaa/knowledge_graph.py currently provides basic graph storage. The specification mentions "Symbolic
     inference engines can perform complex logical deductions."
   * Improvement: Implement fundamental graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search
     (DFS) for traversal, or simple pathfinding) within knowledge_graph.py to lay the groundwork for these
     symbolic inference capabilities.
