Vector Dimensions: Vectors (K,Ψ,D,M,U) are represented as dense embeddings, suggested to be in the range of 128 to 2048 dimensions.

Vectorization: Operations are vectorized using matrix multiplications for efficient computation of bonds (B) and weights (W).

Stabilization: Continuous encoders are stabilized with normalization and gradient clipping.

Forgetting Prevention: Experience replay or reservoir sampling is used for web ingestion to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Minimal Parameter Set (Example): Suggested constants for initial tuning include:

    η=0.1 (Metamorphosis rate)

    λΦ​=0.2 (Unravel rate)

    γ=0.5

    δ=0.05 (Mimicry rate)

    λM​=0.1,λD​=0.05,λU​=0.02

    α=1.0,β=1.0 (Stress Tensor coefficients)
