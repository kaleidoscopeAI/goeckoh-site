    PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Used PCA to reduce the high-dimensional feature vector to 3D for visualization. This is a more robust and statistically sound method than simply using a few features directly.

    Energy Calculation: The energy calculation is now based on the distance to the mean of the data points, which is more appropriate, and in the reduced 3D space.

    Relative Energy for Mutation: The node_adaptation method now uses the 75th percentile of energy levels to determine "high energy." This makes the system more adaptive to different datasets.

    Similarity Search: Implemented find_similar_molecules to search for molecules similar to a given SMILES string using Tanimoto similarity on ECFP4 fingerprints.

    Molecule Details Retrieval: Added get_molecule_details to retrieve the SMILES string and feature vector for a molecule by its index. This is useful for interactive exploration.

    Stored Molecule Objects: The RDKit molecule objects themselves are now stored in the graph, so you can access them for further calculations or visualization.

    Click Event Handling (Plotly): Included an example of a click event handler in the visualize_cube function. You'll need to expand this to perform actions based on clicks (e.g., display details, highlight similar molecules). This will require a callback function.
