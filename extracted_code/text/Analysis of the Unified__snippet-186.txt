Architecture: Renders 50,000+ nodes using React, Three.js, and a Web Worker.

Decoupling: Rendering and physics calculations are completely decoupled via Shared Buffers, resulting in Zero main-thread CPU load.

Analysis: This architecture allows for deterministic analysis, where the user can freeze, replay, and sample the full state for scientific computation.

Network Layout: The Resonance Network visualization specifically uses nx.spring_layout with a fixed seed=42 for deterministic, reproducible visualization of connections.
