• Forgetting Mechanisms: Explicitly or implicitly discounting the influence of older data to focus on more recent observations. This can be achieved through techniques like discounted regret formulations.50
• Adaptive Learning Rates/Regularization: Adjusting optimization parameters (like learning rates or regularization strength) based on the observed data characteristics or performance metrics, rather than using fixed values.50 Algorithms based on Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL) are often employed here.50
• Dynamic Regret Minimization: Evaluating performance against the best possible sequence of changing parameters or models, rather than a single fixed optimal model. This explicitly accounts for nonstationarity.52 The Adaptive Learning for Dynamic Environments (Ader) algorithm is cited as achieving optimal dynamic regret bounds of (O(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})), where (T) is time and (P_T) is the path-length (cumulative change) of the optimal comparator sequence.52 Such algorithms often involve maintaining multiple "expert" learners tuned for different levels of nonstationarity and combining their predictions.52
• Handling Non-Independent Data: Dynamical systems inherently produce correlated data streams. Online learning algorithms applied in this context must be robust to this lack of independence, a challenge often addressed in system identification and adaptive control literature.2
