- The system's core is a `HybridState` containing both continuous (vector) and
  discrete (bit-string) data for a network of nodes.
- A `SemanticHamiltonian` defines the system's total "energy," quantifying
  its cognitive stress and incoherence.
- A `MetropolisEngine` uses simulated annealing to optimize the discrete bit
  states, allowing the system to find globally optimal configurations.
- A `GradientFlow` engine optimizes the continuous vector states via
  gradient descent.
