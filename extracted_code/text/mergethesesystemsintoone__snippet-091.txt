Other Dependencies:NodeManager: Used in SystemVisualizer but not defined. It’s assumed to manage node instances.Fix: Implement a class to store and retrieve nodes, possibly integrated with AdvancedOrchestrator.

MemoryGraph: Referenced in AdvancedOrchestrator and SystemVisualizer but missing. It’s likely a NetworkX graph for system memory.Fix: Define a class using NetworkX to store nodes, edges, and metadata.

DataPipeline: Mentioned in AdvancedOrchestrator but not provided. It seems to handle data flow between nodes.Fix: Create a class with a queue and consumer registration (e.g., using queue.Queue or asyncio).
