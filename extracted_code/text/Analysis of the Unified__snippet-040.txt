    Performance: Renders 50,000+ nodes without lag using React, Three.js, and a Web Worker.

    Decoupling: Rendering and physics are decoupled via Shared Buffers, resulting in Zero main-thread CPU load.

    Deterministic Analysis: The system allows the user to freeze, replay, and sample the full state for rigorous computation.

    Network Plot: The Resonance Network visualization uses nx.spring_layout with a fixed seed=42 for reproducible layout.
