• Goal: Introduce integration analysis, attention mechanisms, and dynamic adaptation.
• Tasks:
    ◦ Develop the CSA with Φ approximation heuristics (e.g., Ricci curvature, connectivity metrics).
    ◦ Implement attention mechanisms for GW access and a simple MC.
    ◦ Apply Ricci flow to adjust network connections dynamically.
    ◦ Measure GWT metrics (e.g., broadcast effectiveness).
• Tools: Discrete Ricci curvature, Ricci flow, machine learning.
• Evaluation: Assess Φ proxies, attention/control effectiveness, and network adaptation.
