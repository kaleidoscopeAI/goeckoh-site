   * The current update_position method in umaa/node.py calculates repulsive forces between all pairs of nodes,
     leading to an O(N^2) complexity. For a larger number of nodes, this will become a significant bottleneck.
   * Improvement: Implement a spatial partitioning technique (e.g., a simple grid-based system) to efficiently
     find nearby nodes. This would reduce the complexity to O(N) or O(N log N), drastically improving performance
     for larger systems.
