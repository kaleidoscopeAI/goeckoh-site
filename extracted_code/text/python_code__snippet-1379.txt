"""
Return the path for the .egg-link file if it exists, otherwise, None.

There's 3 scenarios:
1) not in a virtualenv
   try to find in site.USER_SITE, then site_packages
2) in a no-global virtualenv
   try to find in site_packages
3) in a yes-global virtualenv
   try to find in site_packages, then site.USER_SITE
   (don't look in global location)

For #1 and #3, there could be odd cases, where there's an egg-link in 2
locations.

This method will just return the first one found.
