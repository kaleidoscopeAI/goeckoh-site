    Novel Approach: Investigate quantum-inspired similarity measures. These could involve using quantum algorithms to compare molecular wavefunctions or other quantum representations of molecules. While full-scale quantum computing for this is still in the future, simulating quantum algorithms on classical computers can offer advantages. Explore research in quantum machine learning for molecular property prediction and similarity searching.
