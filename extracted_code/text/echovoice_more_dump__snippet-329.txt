From "Unified Metamorphosis AI Prototype_ Full Implementation.pdf": UMAA Hamiltonian H as global energy (now overrides previous; includes bit alignment, pos, tether, reg), Cognitive Annealing with Parallel Tempering (added to step for escaping minima), QSIN for real-time data (web ingestion via fetch, entanglement as correlation), Kaleidoscope Core (reflection now with Ollama HTTP, self-validation loop).
From "Unified Nexus Intelligence (UNI) – Architecture and Implementation.pdf": Forman-Ricci Flow (FRF) for graph evolution (added to geometry step, smoothing curvature Rij), tensor fields T for semantics (e now tensor [128, D]), SDEs for dynamics (vel/pos now SDE with Wiener noise), quantum-like Teff string tension (feedback to grads), V-A-S emotional model (c now [valence, arousal, stance, coherence]), Semantic Torque τ (gates LLM calls), Recursive Self-Modeling (LLM output re-embedded for meta-params).
From "A. Project layout (what to create).pdf": Cognitive Physics Layer (unified E = f(energy, coherence, valence) - λ A cos(Δϕ)), Neuro-Symbolic Binding (lightweight KG over nodes, transformer over symbols+states), Adaptive Meta-Learning (meta-controller evolves rates via valence grads), Embodied Feedback (hardware state like CPU load into c), Cognitive Crystallization Memory (persistent crystals via FAISS subspaces), Multi-Agent Reflection (WebSocket sync, phase coherence).
From "I. Foundational _ Primitive operators (System of Thought Engines — Levels 0–19).pdf": All ~75 equations added to math section (Levels 0-19 primitives, system operators, HCCF, Metamorphosis, QES-AI, drug cube, relational quantum, strays). Bit changes tracked per level (e.g., AND/OR at L0 mutate bits, vector axioms at L2 aggregate, etc.).
Screenshots: Node blueprint reinforced (metrics/viz), particle images as viz inspiration (clustering=supernodes, halo=low E, bubbles=zoom on A), Gemini link (inferred as integration plan, added self-programming via LLM), equation lists (verbatim added).
