Kaleidoscope (Software Analysis):

    kaleidoscope-merged.py: The core engine for ingesting, analyzing, and "mimicking" (re-writing) software.

    code-reusability-module(2).py: The key innovation for Kaleidoscope, defining a Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that allows the system to represent any programming language in a single, common format for analysis.

Autonomous Processor (Data Analysis):

    autonomous-processor.py: This module acts as the system's perceptual and analytical arm for unstructured data. It autonomously scans a data environment, identifies patterns, detects anomalies, and discovers connections in various file types (CSV, JSON, text).
