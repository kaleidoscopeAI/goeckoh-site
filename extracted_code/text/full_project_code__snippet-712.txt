The first line is number 1.

Note - the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
before starting the parsing process.  See :class:`ParserElement.parse_string`
for more information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and
suggested methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the
parse location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.
