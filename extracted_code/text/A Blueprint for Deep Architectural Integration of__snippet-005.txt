### Real-world Systems Inspiration

    - The **PLASTIC neural networks** and **weightless neural networks (WNNs)** described by James A. Anderson leverage RAM-based bitwise associative mechanisms for cognitive tasks.
    - The **CLARION architecture** blends symbolic and subsymbolic levels with bitwise feature activations controlling rule-based reasoning.
    - The **binarized neural networks (BNNs)** used for hardware-efficient deep learning provide a modern inspiration for bit-level transformer approximations.

***

### Next Steps

    - Detailed design of individual bitwise Thought Engines $O_i$, including logic tables and encoding schemes.
    - Bitwise implementation of $G$ via digital circuits or efficient software bit operators (AND, OR, XOR, shifts).
    - Encoding curiosity bit update as combinational logic with threshold gates.

If desired, I can prepare concrete Rust code examples implementing these bitwise neural modules, routing logic, and curiosity bit update with sample simulations demonstrating their function within your cognitive architecture framework.

# proceed

Below is a concrete example of how to implement key parts of your cognitive architecture entirely with bit-level operators in Rust, focusing on:
    - The curiosity bit update as a boolean threshold gate,
    - Bitwise routing flags,
    - Bit-encoded state vectors with bitwise logic for ThoughtEngine input/output projection,
    - Integration via bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, shifts),

This serves as a template for realizing your architecture in a highly efficient, bitwise manner.
