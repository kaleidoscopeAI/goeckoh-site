"status": "Functionally Complete with Groundbreaking Potential, But Requiring Refinement",
"overview": "The system is functional and provides a framework for a self-contained AGI, demonstrating unique capabilities in specific aspects like memory handling and distributed node processing, but is not at the level to perform real-time interactions to discover new insight based upon novel biological relationships.",
 "summary" : "The system contains an implemented working AGI system however still is in need for more iterative cycles of self improvement , better interaction between nodes, full implementation of reasoning and desion logic systems using the methods that have been laid out." ,
   "strengths": [
    "Standalone Code: No reliance on external AI models or GPU acceleration.",
      "Multi-Modal Input: Handles numerical, text and visual data, preparing for any inputs using helper modules.",
    "Unique Architecture: Implements self-evolving networks, dynamic nodes with adaptable DNA traits, and novel forms of knowledge integration",
