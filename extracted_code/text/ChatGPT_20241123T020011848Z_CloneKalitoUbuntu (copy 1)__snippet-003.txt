I’ll create an initial draft of this recursive structure in code, representing how a “parent” node holds the rules for replication and interaction, and how these rules get passed to “child” nodes with slight adaptations. This approach gives us the “seed” that can grow into an intelligent, interconnected ecosystem all on its own, using the rules of its own “genetic” structure.
