  - Chart card restyled with a minimalist header and “Download CSV” button
    (exports current telemetry to mirror_telemetry.csv).
  - Dual-axis chart now shows GCL, drift, and latency; added latency p50/p95
    + gate-block cards; recent telemetry table remains.
  - Keeps soft colors and rounded edges for a professional, non-blocky look.
