• Goal: Evaluate against consciousness metrics and refine iteratively.
• Tasks:
    ◦ Measure Φ proxies and GWT dynamics (e.g., information integration).
    ◦ Analyze emergent behaviors and conduct lesion studies.
    ◦ Refine architecture and algorithms based on results.
• Tools: All prior tools, advanced analytics.
• Evaluation: Assess theoretical alignment, robustness, and emergent properties.
