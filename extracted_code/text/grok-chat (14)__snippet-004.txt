I'm now in the process of applying the math concepts to the code. Specifically, I'm integrating the formant bandwidth formula, around 50 Hz, which influences filter coefficients for each formant. Using scipy.signal.iirpeak is a valid method, but I'm leaning toward building resonators with tf2sos for stability. I've structured a class DigitalVoice to hold the state. I'm focusing on refining the source generation using scipy.signal.sawtooth and incorporating a noise floor for breathiness, which is implemented as scaled white noise. I'll need to link the code back to the underlying equations.
