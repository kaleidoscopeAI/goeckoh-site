> > I've shifted focus to scripting. I'm now implementing the DSP logic, specifically in the newly created `neuro_acoustic/mod.rs` to keep things organized. This will contain functions for RMS calculation and basic filtering, driven by the lattice state. Next, I'm integrating the lattice access with `stream.rs`, using `try_lock` to ensure the audio thread doesn't block. Finally, `lib.rs` will be updated to orchestrate the entire interaction.
