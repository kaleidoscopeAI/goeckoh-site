pygments.scanner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library implements a regex based scanner. Some languages
like Pascal are easy to parse but have some keywords that
depend on the context. Because of this it's impossible to lex
that just by using a regular expression lexer like the
`RegexLexer`.

Have a look at the `DelphiLexer` to get an idea of how to use
this scanner.
