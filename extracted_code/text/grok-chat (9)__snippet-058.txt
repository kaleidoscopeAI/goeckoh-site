  floor updates, and denoising logic using FFT-based Wiener filtering and
  spectral gating. I’m setting up how to feed pre-roll audio to ASR on speech
  start, handle noise profile updates only during non-speech, and integrate
  telemetry metrics. It also covers helper methods for power-of-two FFT sizing,
  windowing, and robustness checks before actual coding.

  Finalizing noise reduction and SNR computations

  I’m refining noise reduction to handle different modes—wiener, spectral
  gating, or both—and implementing efficient SNR estimation based on RMS and
  noise floor to avoid redundant FFTs. The noise floor adapts modestly, VAD
  threshold calculation clamps values sensibly, and telemetry updates will
  include SNR and VAD state. I’m preparing to carefully apply these detailed
  incremental code changes.
