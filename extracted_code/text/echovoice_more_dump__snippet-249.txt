• Goal: Enhance complexity, grounding, and tool integration.
• Tasks:
    ◦ Scale SM diversity and GW capacity using TNs (e.g., PEPS).
    ◦ Upgrade the CSA with TN-based Φ estimation.
    ◦ Enhance the GI with real-time data integration and neurosymbolic grounding.
    ◦ Use PDE/SDE solvers for realistic simulations.
    ◦ Refine MC strategies with CSA/GI feedback.
• Tools: TNs, numerical solvers, neurosymbolic AI, real-time data integration.
• Evaluation: Test complex task performance, grounding accuracy, and system stability.
