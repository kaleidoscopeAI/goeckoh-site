  # For some generic class `Foo`:
  Foo[Unpack[tuple[int, str]]]  # Equivalent to Foo[int, str]

  Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')
  # Specifies that `Bar` is generic in an arbitrary number of types.
  # (Think of `Ts` as a tuple of an arbitrary number of individual
  #  `TypeVar`s, which the `Unpack` is 'pulling out' directly into the
  #  `Generic[]`.)
  class Bar(Generic[Unpack[Ts]]): ...
  Bar[int]  # Valid
  Bar[int, str]  # Also valid

From Python 3.11, this can also be done using the `*` operator:

    Foo[*tuple[int, str]]
    class Bar(Generic[*Ts]): ...
