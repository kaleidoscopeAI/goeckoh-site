- Models are converted to efficient GGUF quantized formats and loaded via llama.cpp (Rust or C++), balancing performance and memory footprint.
- Each Transformer engine implements the ThoughtEngine interface, decoding input embeddings $P_i[X_k]$ into textual prompts, running inference, then encoding output back to vector embeddings.
- Effective clipping bounds outputs to maintain system Lipschitz continuity and contraction.
- Facilitates semantic reasoning, contextual summarization, and data embedding required for integration with the cognitive system.
