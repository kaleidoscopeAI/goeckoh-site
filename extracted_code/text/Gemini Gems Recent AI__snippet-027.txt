    Represent molecules as quantum states (e.g., using a simplified wavefunction representation).

    Develop a quantum-inspired similarity measure that takes into account the quantum properties of the molecules. This could involve calculating the overlap between molecular wavefunctions or using other quantum information metrics.

    Simulate this quantum similarity measure on a classical computer (or, eventually, run it on a quantum computer).

    Use the quantum-enhanced similarity scores to identify similar molecules in the Molecular Cube.
