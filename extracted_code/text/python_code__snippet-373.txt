"""
Return the version of the current OS distribution, as a human-readable
string.

If *pretty* is false, the version is returned without codename (e.g.
"7.0").

If *pretty* is true, the codename in parenthesis is appended, if the
codename is non-empty (e.g. "7.0 (Maipo)").

Some distributions provide version numbers with different precisions in
the different sources of distribution information. Examining the different
sources in a fixed priority order does not always yield the most precise
version (e.g. for Debian 8.2, or CentOS 7.1).

Some other distributions may not provide this kind of information. In these
cases, an empty string would be returned. This behavior can be observed
with rolling releases distributions (e.g. Arch Linux).

The *best* parameter can be used to control the approach for the returned
version:

If *best* is false, the first non-empty version number in priority order of
the examined sources is returned.

If *best* is true, the most precise version number out of all examined
sources is returned.

**Lookup hierarchy:**

In all cases, the version number is obtained from the following sources.
If *best* is false, this order represents the priority order:

* the value of the "VERSION_ID" attribute of the os-release file,
* the value of the "Release" attribute returned by the lsb_release
  command,
* the version number parsed from the "<version_id>" field of the first line
  of the distro release file,
* the version number parsed from the "PRETTY_NAME" attribute of the
  os-release file, if it follows the format of the distro release files.
* the version number parsed from the "Description" attribute returned by
  the lsb_release command, if it follows the format of the distro release
  files.
