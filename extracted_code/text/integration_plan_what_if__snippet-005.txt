*   **Child's Response:** AGI monitors child's subsequent audio, physiological changes (if sensors available), and environmental impact.
*   **Crystalline Memory Update:** New interaction data, outcomes, and internal state changes are fed back into Crystalline Memory.
*   **Organic Evolution:** Successful strategies reinforce node pathways; failures might trigger mutations or pruning within the "Organic AI." The master Hamiltonian is continuously re-tuned.
*   **Caregiver Feedback:** Caregivers can provide explicit feedback via the GUI, which directly influences the AGI's learning and adaptation parameters.
