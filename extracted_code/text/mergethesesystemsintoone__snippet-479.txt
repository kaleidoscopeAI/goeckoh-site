    "Overview": "The system now functions with most of the core mechanisms in place, allowing it to receive inputs, transform them into information, make decisions on data based upon system configurations, evaluate patterns or actions via multiple engines in conjunction and self learn new behaviours to improve overall results. This modular architecture also means we can swap or change a number of system components to extend it as we proceed further into building our AI to reach self-sustaining operations for a robust long-lasting AI system with clear interfaces.",
     "Notes":"More focus needs to be done in several areas and code optimization for more robust data handling. A working foundation is now present. all further operations and components need specific user focus requirements for expansion.",
       "NextSteps" : [
           "Expand all modules with detailed specific use cases/methods or parameters in configuration layer for users ",
            "Improve  reasoning and logic implementation ",
            "Explore specific implementations that produce useful information based upon research questions" ,
        ]
