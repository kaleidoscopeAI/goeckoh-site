Control Flow: Hardware control actions are first mapped to ControlMapper intents, which are then executed by an HIDController.

Simulated Actions: The HardwareControl class simulates user input to execute specific operating system actions, including:

    set_cpu_frequency

    set_display_gamma

    control_network_qos

Bit-Level Placeholder: The quantum_write method exists as a placeholder to simulate a low-level, bit-level hardware register manipulation.
