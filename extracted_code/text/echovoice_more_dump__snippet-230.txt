• Solution 2: Browser Extension Mechanisms: Chrome extensions can use specific manifest permissions (host_permissions for http://localhost:11434/* or http://127.0.0.1:11434/*) and potentially APIs like chrome.declarativeNetRequest to modify request headers (e.g., setting the Origin header to http://localhost) to bypass standard CORS checks for allowed origins.86 This requires careful configuration within the extension's manifest and background scripts.
• Solution 3: Server-Side Proxy: Implement a backend service (e.g., using Node.js) that runs on the same machine as Ollama. The browser application communicates with this backend proxy, which then makes the requests to http://localhost:11434. Since the proxy-to-Ollama communication is server-to-server on localhost, CORS issues are avoided.88
