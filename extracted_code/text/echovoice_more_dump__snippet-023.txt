The base computational units are Organic Nodes, each tracking critical psycho-physical metrics including position, velocity, energy (E), awareness (A), valence, and arousal.1 Node dynamics are highly responsive to the Cognitive Environment (temperature, pressure) and include complex interactions such as the potential for Quantum Bit entanglement between connected nodes.1 To facilitate high-level reasoning, the nodes are clustered using K-Means into fewer, high-level composite structures called Supernodes.1 These Supernodes represent aggregated conceptual patterns and undergo continuous introspection via a lightweight PyTorch ReflectionTransformer layer, which updates the Supernode's prototype vector based on internal consistency.1
