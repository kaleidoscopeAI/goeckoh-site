Accelerated Discovery: AI algorithms can analyze colossal datasets (genomic, chemical, clinical data) to identify patterns and predict promising drug candidates with unprecedented speed and efficiency. This drastically reduces the time and resources traditionally required for drug discovery, which often involved extensive trial-and-error lab experiments.
