- **Efficient Architecture:** Sparsely connected routing $R$ with threshold $\theta$ efficiently gates communication between specialized Thought Engines such as Hugging Face transformer-based \$ O_{LLM} \$ and \$ O_{embedding} \$, alongside \$ O_{crawl} \$.
- **Bit-Level Reduction:** The continuous curiosity state \$ c_k \$ is replaced by a one-bit curiosity flag \$ b_k \$, transforming all cognition and routing operations to bitwise operators enabling classical CPUs and hardware acceleration via SIMD instructions and simple digital logic.
- **Implementation Viability:** Hugging Face transformers are integrated using quantized GGUF models loaded with llama.cpp in Rust, asynchronously co-managed with the bitwise cognitive core, maintaining Lipschitz continuity by output clipping and pruning.
