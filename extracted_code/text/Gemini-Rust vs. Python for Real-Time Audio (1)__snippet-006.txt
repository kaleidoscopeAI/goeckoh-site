> > I've made headway in setting up the `uniffi` scaffold and defining the `GoeckohEngine` struct. Key functions like `new()`, `start_audio()`, and `stop_audio()` are now exposed, along with a `get_affective_state()` placeholder. The `EmotionalState` struct is ready to relay data. My focus is on thread safety, using `Arc<Mutex<...>>` for shared state. Next step: either the `ode_solver` or the `audio_stream` implementation.
