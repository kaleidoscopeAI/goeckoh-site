Since the system incorporates coupled conservative forces, dissipative forces (Thought Engines, Emotional Flow), and stochastic terms (noise ξi​(t)) 1, a technique called Operator Splitting (e.g., Strang splitting) is mandated. This process breaks the complex system dynamics into simpler, integrable parts—half-step conservative, full-step dissipative, second half-step conservative—which are then combined within a single time step Δt, maintaining numerical robustness.1 The dissipative ODEs for the Emotional Chemical Flow (C) and the Thought Engines (χi​), which govern the transient cognitive state, are reliably integrated using the robust and well-understood Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method.1
