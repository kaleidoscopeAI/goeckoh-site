"""Check for Apple's ``osx_framework_library`` scheme.

Python distributed by Apple's Command Line Tools has this special scheme
that's used when:

* This is a framework build.
* We are installing into the system prefix.

This does not account for ``pip install --prefix`` (also means we're not
installing to the system prefix), which should use ``posix_prefix``, but
logic here means ``_infer_prefix()`` outputs ``osx_framework_library``. But
since ``prefix`` is not available for ``sysconfig.get_default_scheme()``,
which is the stdlib replacement for ``_infer_prefix()``, presumably Apple
wouldn't be able to magically switch between ``osx_framework_library`` and
``posix_prefix``. ``_infer_prefix()`` returning ``osx_framework_library``
means its behavior is consistent whether we use the stdlib implementation
or our own, and we deal with this special case in ``get_scheme()`` instead.
