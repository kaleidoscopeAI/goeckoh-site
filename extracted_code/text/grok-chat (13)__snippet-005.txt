I've decided to simplify the approach for fricatives and plosives to maintain code clarity, using bandpass filters and short bursts of sound, respectively. The code structure will utilize scipy for filters, numpy for arrays, a PhonemeTable for lookups, a SequenceGenerator to handle text-to-frames, and a Synthesizer for rendering. This is essentially a basic, self-built vocal synthesizer! I'll clarify that this demo focuses on the physics of control and won't tackle full linguistic parsing.
