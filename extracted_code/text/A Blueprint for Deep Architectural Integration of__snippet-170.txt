- Real-world crawling requires careful error handling. Malicious content and rate limits necessitate robust sandboxing. The system should incorporate input validation, anomaly detection, and fallback policies.
- LLM vulnerability to adversarial inputs can be addressed by ensemble validation with external fact-checking or consensus models.
- Semaphores must be extended to full resource schedulers with dynamic quotas and priority-based crawling rate limiting.
