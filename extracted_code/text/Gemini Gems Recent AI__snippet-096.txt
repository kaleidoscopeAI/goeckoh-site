3D Visualization: Setting up Three.js (or any 3D library) correctly and efficiently rendering molecular data requires a fair amount of code and understanding of 3D graphics concepts.

Asynchronous Tasks (Celery): Handling asynchronous tasks with Celery adds another layer of complexity, especially for a simplified example.

Database Integration: While important for a real application, database interaction adds overhead to a simplified example.

Quantum-Inspired Similarity: The "quantum-inspired" part is conceptually interesting but requires more research and isn't essential for a basic, runnable example. We can use a simpler similarity measure to start.
