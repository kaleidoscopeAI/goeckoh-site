• Ulam Spiral: Integers arranged on a square grid spiral, revealing diagonal lines rich in prime numbers.43
• Sacks Spiral: An Archimedean spiral ((r \propto \theta)) where integers are placed such that perfect squares align on the positive x-axis. It also reveals prime number patterns along specific curves related to prime-generating polynomials.43 The polar coordinates are often given as (r = \sqrt{i}), (\theta = 2\pi \sqrt{i}) for integer (i).45
• Fermat Spiral: Defined by (r^2 = a^2 \theta) (or (r = a \sqrt{\theta})). Related to disc phyllotaxis where elements have uniform size.48
• Vogel Spiral: A discrete model closely mimicking sunflower seed arrangements.45 It places the (n)-th point (integer) at polar coordinates: r(n)=cn​ θ(n)=n×ψ where (c) is a scaling constant and (\psi) is the golden angle ((\approx 137.5^\circ)).46 Some formulations use related angles like (2\pi n / \phi^2).47 This model explicitly uses the golden angle to achieve efficient packing and naturally aligns Fibonacci numbers along certain axes.47 It has been used to visualize number-theoretic properties, such as the number of prime factors of each integer, revealing intricate patterns.45 Extensions to 3D have also been explored.46
