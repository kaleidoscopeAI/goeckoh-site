1. Representing Complex States: The state space of the entire CQICS system, or significant sub-components like the GW content or the Φ-structure itself, can be extremely high-dimensional. TNs, particularly PEPS or more general tensor network structures 22, offer a compressed and structured way to represent these states, potentially capturing complex correlations and dependencies far more efficiently than a flat vector representation.
2. Modeling Φ-Structures: There is a compelling conceptual mapping between the structure of a TN and IIT's Φ-structure. A TN explicitly represents a system as interconnected parts (tensors) with dependencies mediated by shared indices (bonds).21 This mirrors the Φ-structure composed of interacting mechanisms (distinctions) and their causal relationships (relations).8 The bond dimension in a TN, which controls its representational power and the amount of correlation it can capture, could potentially correspond to the degree of integration or complexity within the represented Φ-structure.
3. Optimization and State Finding: Finding the system configuration that maximizes Φ, or optimizing the system's dynamics according to some objective related to IIT or GWT principles, can be framed as an optimization problem over the high-dimensional state space. Algorithms developed for TNs, such as DMRG for MPS-like structures 20 or various optimization techniques for PEPS 20 (potentially leveraging hardware accelerators like TPUs 24), could be adapted within the CSA or MC to search for optimal states or parameters.
4. Efficient Computation and Gauging: A major challenge in using TNs is the computational cost of contracting the network, especially for PEPS and general TNs.20 Approximate methods like Belief Propagation (BP) 20 or loop series expansions 20 offer ways to estimate contractions or properties of the TN more efficiently. BP, in particular, has close ties to TNs and can be used not only for contraction but also for "gauging" the network.22 BP gauging transforms the TN into a canonical form (like the Vidal gauge) 22, which can stabilize numerical computations and facilitate operations like truncation or time evolution, potentially useful for maintaining a consistent representation of the Φ-structure within the CSA.
