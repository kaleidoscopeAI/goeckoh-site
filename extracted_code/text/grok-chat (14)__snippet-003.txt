I've been working on refining the code architecture. Currently, I'm focusing on the synthesize_voice function. I'm exploring series resonators for better vowel representation. Jitter is now being implemented using a cumulative phase approach, which should improve the sound. I've opted for a pulse train with a low-pass filter to simulate the glottal source. Formants will be implemented using second-order resonant filters, defined by frequency and bandwidth. I'm striving for a clearer structure as I continue the development.
