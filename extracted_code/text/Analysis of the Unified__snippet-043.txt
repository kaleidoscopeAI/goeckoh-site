    Compliance Evaluation: The final score is calculated using a weighted average of compliance scores for all principles, including adjustments for related principles found via graph traversal:
    Compliance=1+∑Edge WeightBase Compliance+∑(Edge Weight×Related Score)​

    Adaptation: After an action, the principle's success_rate is updated, and the system uses update_learning to adjust the principle's confidence and context_sensitivity based on the outcome feedback.
