unified_organic_ai_skeleton_v_1.py: This provides a clean, asynchronous, and modular skeleton for the "Organic AI." It defines clear interfaces and orchestrates components like the UnifiedCrystallineMemory, QuantumInspiredOptimizer, and ConsciousnessEngine.

cognitive_crystal_system.py: A similar but more integrated implementation that includes a web server (Quart). It demonstrates how the system can run continuously, respond to external queries, and engage its CognitiveCrystalMachine for an LLM-based reflection loop.
