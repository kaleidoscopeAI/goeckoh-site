Interactive Visualization: Plotly is an excellent choice for this application. The interactivity is essential for understanding the relationships within the cube.

SMILES Integration: Reading SMILES strings directly makes the system much more practical. This is the standard way to represent molecules in cheminformatics.

Clearer Feature Mapping: While the features are still simplified, using molecular weight and rotatable bonds is a good starting point. It's much better than random numbers.

Tooltips: Providing tooltips with SMILES strings and energy levels is a great way to make the data more accessible.

Error Handling: Including a check for invalid SMILES strings is important for robustness.
