> > I've been solidifying the dependencies for the core crate. I've chosen `cpal` for cross-platform audio and `oboe` for Android's low-latency needs. Linear algebra and ODE solving will be handled by `nalgebra`, which seems a better fit than `ndarray` for the project's physics focus. `uniffi` will serve as the FFI bridge, with `jni` as a fallback. `tokio` will handle async control logic, while `serde` ensures robust serialization, and `log` or `tracing` plus `android_logger` will handle logging and debugging. The package name is `goeckoh_core`, and the version is currently under consideration.
