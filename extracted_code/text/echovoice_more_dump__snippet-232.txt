• Richer Bio-Inspired Adaptation: Exploring more sophisticated computational models inspired by neuroscience and cognitive science, such as hierarchical predictive coding or global workspace theory, to implement adaptation.
• Hierarchical Processing: Structuring the Cube X System into multiple layers of abstraction, allowing for adaptation at different levels of granularity.
• Autonomous LLM Agents: Moving beyond using LLMs as advisors or interpreters to deploying autonomous LLM agents (potentially built using frameworks like LangChain or AutoGen) that operate within the Cube X System, actively exploring, interpreting, and modifying the state space based on higher-level goals. This could leverage Ollama's tool-use capabilities more extensively.70
• Formal Analysis: Developing rigorous mathematical analysis of the stability, convergence, and emergent properties of the combined system, particularly the interaction between the adaptive mechanisms and the integrated LLMs.
• Explainability and Trust: Creating methods to make the adaptive reasoning and the LLM's contributions more transparent and interpretable, building trust in the system's outputs.
