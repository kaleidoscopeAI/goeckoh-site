• Fine-tuning/Prompting Needs: As noted, Phi-2 likely requires either an effective instruction-following fine-tune (like Dolphin Phi 13, available on the Ollama Hub 14) or sophisticated system prompts to generate consistent conversational output [User Plan]. Mistral 7B Instruct 2 and Llama 3.2 3B Instruct 5 are pre-tuned for chat/instructions and readily available as GGUF models on platforms like Hugging Face and directly usable with Ollama.6 Should custom fine-tuning be considered, tools like Unsloth 32 or Axolotl 11 can facilitate the process, followed by conversion to GGUF using llama.cpp tools (convert.py, quantize).11
