    Clearer Feature Mapping: While the features are still simplified, using molecular weight and rotatable bonds is a good starting point. It's much better than random numbers.

    Tooltips: Providing tooltips with SMILES strings and energy levels is a great way to make the data more accessible.

    Error Handling: Including a check for invalid SMILES strings is important for robustness.
