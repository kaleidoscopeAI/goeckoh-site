Docking Integration: If you're using molecular docking, you'll need to integrate your docking program (e.g., AutoDock Vina) into your backend. This will involve setting up the docking calculations, running them asynchronously, and retrieving the results.

Molecular Dynamics Integration: If you're incorporating MD simulations, you'll need to integrate your MD engine (e.g., AMBER, GROMACS) into your backend. This will be similar to docking integration.

Quantum-Inspired Algorithms: You'll need to continue research and development on the quantum-inspired algorithms. The current implementation is a simplified placeholder.

Graph Neural Networks: Integrating GNNs will require a significant effort. You'll need to choose a GNN library (PyTorch Geometric, Deep Graph Library), design your GNN architecture, train your models, and integrate them into your backend.
