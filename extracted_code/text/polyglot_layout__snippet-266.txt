    The 3D panel was blank because no avatar frames were streamed to it. (We sent metrics, not node positions.)

    Some flows still assumed manual seeding (e.g., “Add Wikipedia seed”) rather than always-on ingest.
    “No-API” promise was diluted by optional online pieces being treated as required (e.g., downloads/models).
    Avatar generation originally used node dynamics, but the UI didn’t reflect that live feed.
