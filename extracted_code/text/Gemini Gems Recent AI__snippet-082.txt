Dash Integration: The code now uses Dash to create a web application.

Layout: The layout includes the 3D Plotly graph, input fields for SMILES, buttons for similarity search and details, and divs to display the results. I've added Bootstrap styling for a nicer look.

Callbacks: Dash callbacks connect the UI elements to the Python functions. When a button is clicked or input changes, the corresponding callback is triggered.

Data Storage: The cube data (the graph) is stored in a hidden div using dcc.Store as JSON. This is a way to transfer data between the callbacks. For very large datasets, this could become a bottleneck. A more efficient approach would be to store the data in a database or use a server-side caching mechanism.

Callback Functions: The callback functions handle the similarity searches (classical and quantum-inspired) and molecule details retrieval.

Click Event Callback (Placeholder): I've added a comment indicating where you would add a callback to handle click events on the 3D graph. This callback would update the smiles-input field with the SMILES of the clicked molecule.
