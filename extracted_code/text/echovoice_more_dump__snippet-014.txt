The "Unified Conscious Cube Architecture Plan" presents a well-considered and ambitious design for a system exploring emergent cognition through the integration of physics simulation, LLM-driven reflection, and interactive visualization. The proposed unified architecture, centered around a single simulation loop and shared state, represents a significant improvement over fragmented scripting approaches. The web-based visualization strategy using Three.js and WebSockets is appropriate and feasible.
