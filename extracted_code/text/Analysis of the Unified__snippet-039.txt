To ground the AI and allow it to modify its host environment, the HardwareControl class achieves "embodiment" via Human Interface Device (HID) Emulation.

    The AI simulates user actions (typing, mouse clicks) to interact with the OS, bypassing low-level drivers.

    Simulated Actions: Mapped to ControlMapper intents, these include: set_cpu_frequency, set_display_gamma, and control_network_qos.

    quantum_write acts as a placeholder for low-level, bit-level hardware register manipulation.
