Missing Imports: The code uses several types and functions that aren't imported (like CrystalError, RunConfig, etc.)

Pygame Dependency: The ImageGraphProcessor uses pygame which isn't a typical Rust dependency

Async Runtime: The block_on calls need a proper async runtime setup

Error Handling: Some error conversions are missing
