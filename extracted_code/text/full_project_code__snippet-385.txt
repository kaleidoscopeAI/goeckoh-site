pygments.plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pygments plugin interface. By default, this tries to use
``importlib.metadata``, which is in the Python standard
library since Python 3.8, or its ``importlib_metadata``
backport for earlier versions of Python. It falls back on
``pkg_resources`` if not found. Finally, if ``pkg_resources``
is not found either, no plugins are loaded at all.

lexer plugins::

    [pygments.lexers]
    yourlexer = yourmodule:YourLexer

formatter plugins::

    [pygments.formatters]
    yourformatter = yourformatter:YourFormatter
    /.ext = yourformatter:YourFormatter

As you can see, you can define extensions for the formatter
with a leading slash.

syntax plugins::

    [pygments.styles]
    yourstyle = yourstyle:YourStyle

filter plugin::

    [pygments.filter]
    yourfilter = yourfilter:YourFilter
