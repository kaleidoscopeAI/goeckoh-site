• Discrete Ricci Curvature: Analyzes network topology in the CSA, identifying integration hubs and bottlenecks to guide Φ approximations.
• Ricci Flow: Dynamically adapts network connections, simulating structural plasticity across SMs and GW.
• Tensor Networks (TNs): Represents high-dimensional states (e.g., Φ-structures, GW content) efficiently, using algorithms like Belief Propagation for optimization.
• Numerical PDE/SDE Solvers: Simulates continuous and stochastic dynamics for system-environment interactions via the GI.
• Neurosymbolic AI: Grounds internal symbols in external knowledge graphs (KGs) through the GI, enhancing meaning and accuracy.
• Real-time Data Integration: Links the GI to external data streams, enabling real-time environmental interaction.
• Machine Learning: Implements SM functions, GW learning, and MC policies, forming the computational foundation.
