    The ``<div>``'s CSS class can be set by the `cssclass` option.

    If the `linenos` option is set to ``"table"``, the ``<pre>`` is
    additionally wrapped inside a ``<table>`` which has one row and two
    cells: one containing the line numbers and one containing the code.
    Example:

    .. sourcecode:: html

        <div class="highlight" >
        <table><tr>
          <td class="linenos" title="click to toggle"
            onclick="with (this.firstChild.style)
                     { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }">
            <pre>1
