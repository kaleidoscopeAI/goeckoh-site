• Recommendation: A hybrid approach is recommended. Implement the Global Thought Panel as the primary, reliable display for all generated thoughts. For displaying selected, contextually important thoughts attached to specific nodes, use THREE.Sprite with THREE.CanvasTexture, optimized with a texture atlas. This involves creating one larger canvas, drawing multiple labels onto it, and updating only the relevant regions when text changes. Limit the number of concurrently visible node-attached sprites to maintain performance, perhaps fading out older ones. Avoid CSS2DRenderer unless the lack of occlusion is acceptable or significant effort is invested in workarounds.
