The HardwareControl class achieves embodiment (allowing the AI to affect its physical environment/host OS) by simulating user actions via Human Interface Device (HID) emulation.

    Control Flow: Hardware control actions are first mapped to ControlMapper intents, which are then executed by an HIDController.

    Simulated Actions: This allows the AI to simulate commands that: set_cpu_frequency, set_display_gamma, and control_network_qos, effectively modifying its own operational environment without needing low-level driver access.

    quantum_write: A specific method is included as a placeholder to simulate a low-level, bit-level hardware register manipulation.
