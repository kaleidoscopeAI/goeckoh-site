Microphone → raw audio (16 kHz)
Whisper (local model) → raw transcription (speech_processing.py)
broken_speech_tool.py → expands abbreviations, fixes “u” → “you”, “pls” → “please”, collapses “heyyy” → “heyy”, etc.
LanguageTool → grammar/spelling correction
Final clean text is fed into the main SpeechLoop (not shown, but referenced heavily)
The SpeechLoop decides what to say back (support voice, correction echo, etc.) and uses gTTS (Google TTS) to speak the response aloud.
