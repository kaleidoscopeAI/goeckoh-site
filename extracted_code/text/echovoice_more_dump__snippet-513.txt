Module Resolution Error:

    The crystal_core module is not found in optimizer. Import it directly instead.

Struct Field Access Errors:

    ChemicalFeatures no longer has fields like atomic_number, formal_charge, etc. Remove these field accesses.

    AdaptiveCoolingParams fields have changed. Update to use available fields.

Private Field Access:

    Use getter methods (accuracy(), precision(), etc.) instead of direct field access for Metrics.
