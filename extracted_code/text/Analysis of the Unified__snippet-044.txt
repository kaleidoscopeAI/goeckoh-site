To allow the AI to affect its host computer (e.g., to implement a calculated power-saving policy), the system bypasses the need for low-level drivers using Human Interface Device (HID) Emulation.

    Control Flow: Hardware control actions are first mapped to ControlMapper intents, which are then executed by an HIDController.

    Simulated Actions: The HardwareControl class simulates user input to execute specific operating system actions, including:

        set_cpu_frequency

        set_display_gamma

        control_network_qos

    Bit-Level Placeholder: The quantum_write method exists as a placeholder to simulate a low-level, bit-level hardware register manipulation.
