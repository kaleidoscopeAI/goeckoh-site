"""Register `distribution_finder` to find distributions in sys.path items

`importer_type` is the type or class of a PEP 302 "Importer" (sys.path item
handler), and `distribution_finder` is a callable that, passed a path
item and the importer instance, yields ``Distribution`` instances found on
that path item.  See ``pkg_resources.find_on_path`` for an example."""
_distribution_finders[importer_type] = distribution_finder
