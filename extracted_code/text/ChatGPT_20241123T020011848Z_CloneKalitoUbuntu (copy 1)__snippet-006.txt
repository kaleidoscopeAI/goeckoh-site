I’ll package up all the working code we have so far, including the latest updates to the `OrganicCore` and `NodeDNA` classes, along with the environment interaction setup. This will create a simple demo that shows node adaptation and replication in action. I’ll assemble it and ensure it’s ready for you to run as a standalone demo.
