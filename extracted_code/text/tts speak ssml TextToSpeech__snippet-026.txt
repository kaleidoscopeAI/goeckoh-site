GCL < 0.5 (Meltdown Risk): The AGI is fully throttled. Its only permitted action is to deploy calming affirmations via the InnerVoiceEngine (e.g., "I am safe. I can breathe.").
GCL 0.5-0.7 (Overload): The AGI is limited to low-risk internal tasks (e.g., logging, self-reflection).
GCL 0.7-0.9 (Baseline): The AGI can perform core functions, such as research and analysis.
GCL > 0.9 (Flow State): Full executive capability is unlocked. The AGI can automate complex external tasks, such as income generation or system automation.

Potential Impact & Applications
The potential of this architecture is vast, touching three distinct domains: therapy, general cognition, and AGI ethics.
3.1. Impact on Therapeutic Modalities

Autism (Primary Application): The system provides a 24/7, patient, non-judgmental therapeutic partner. It directly addresses the hypothesized "prediction error" deficit, while the GCL-gating ensures the system never pushes the user when they are approaching sensory overload. It fosters agency without creating demand.
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): TBI survivors often struggle with speech (aphasia) and emotional regulation. The Neuro-Acoustic Mirror can act as a crucial rehabilitation tool, providing a consistent, error-free feedback loop to help rebuild damaged neural pathways for speech. The Crystalline Heart can monitor for cognitive fatigue and throttle interaction, preventing the "crashes" common in TBI recovery.
Neurodegenerative Disease (Alzheimer's & Dementia): The system's "Autopoietic Identity Maintenance" (where the VoiceCrystal slowly adapts) is profound. For an individual with memory loss, hearing grounding information ("I am in my home. I am safe.") in a voice that is congruent with their own sense of self could be a powerful anchor. It transforms a confusing "assistant" into a familiar "inner voice," potentially reducing anxiety, confusion, and sundowning.
