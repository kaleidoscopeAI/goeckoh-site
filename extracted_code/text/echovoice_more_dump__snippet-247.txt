• Goal: Establish basic CQICS components and information flow in a simulated environment.
• Tasks:
    ◦ Implement SMs using standard AI techniques (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).
    ◦ Create a basic GW as a shared memory buffer.
    ◦ Set up a GI with a simple simulated environment.
    ◦ Use discrete Ricci curvature to analyze the static network topology.
• Tools: Machine learning, graph libraries (e.g., GraphRicciCurvature).
• Evaluation: Verify stable information flow and basic agent responsiveness.
