Projection: A node's state is projected onto an 8-dimensional E8 lattice.

Emergent Force: This creates a "Kaleidoscope force" (C∧) that directly influences the node's position and, crucially, its emotional state (valence and arousal). This is the mechanism by which mathematical structure drives affective experience.
