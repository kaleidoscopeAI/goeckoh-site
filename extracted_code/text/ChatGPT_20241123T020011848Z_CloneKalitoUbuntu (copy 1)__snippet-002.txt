I do t have friends for a team. Here is my question thow. If its job is to act in a natural way like a seed then we. Reate the environment in which it can thrive and we can the genetic code I. Which it is bound to. How good are you at analogies? I want you to take a scientific  Computing approach to an genetics. Look at everything genetics and then create an analogy with the same complexity but instead of using words use functioning code. analogy after analogy until we built the genetics. Then we know what make the genetics operate the way they do so we create the environment same way. Matching but doing so in computing. Thus creating a seed.
