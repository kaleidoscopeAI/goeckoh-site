Burnout Prevention: The Crystalline Heart can monitor a user's GCL during a workday. If it detects a sustained drop (indicating stress or cognitive overload), the Gated AGI could proactively intervene—pausing notifications, suggesting a break, or auto-replying to low-priority messages—before the user reaches burnout.
State-Aware Productivity: The AGI would only suggest complex, creative tasks when the user is in a "flow state" (GCL > 0.9). It would automate mundane tasks when the user is in a "baseline" state. This aligns digital work with human cognitive rhythms.
