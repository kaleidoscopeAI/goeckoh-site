- iOS devices since ~iPhone XR/11 with `PlayAndRecord` + low buffer sizes are typically capable of sub-150 ms round-trip audio when using native APIs and avoiding heavy background load.
- Mid/high-tier Android devices on recent Snapdragon SoCs with low-latency audio paths (AAudio or well-tuned OpenSL ES) and native code can also target <300 ms; the practical limit depends on OEM audio stack quality.
