    We have a CrystalSimulation class that uses a Cognitive Crystal core.

    We need to handle the visualization of the crystal's nodes and bonds.

    We have functions to ingest data (SMILES and Web) and query the crystal's consciousness via Ollama.

    We need to set up the Three.js visualization and update it based on the crystal's state.
