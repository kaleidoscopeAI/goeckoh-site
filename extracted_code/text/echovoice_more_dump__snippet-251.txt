• Computational Complexity: Efficient Φ approximations (e.g., TNs, Ricci curvature) are essential due to IIT's intensive calculations.
• Qualia: The system may achieve correlates of consciousness without guaranteeing subjective experience.
• Scalability/Stability: Managing complex dynamics requires robust design and control.
• Grounding: The GI must ensure meaningful environmental connections.
• Theoretical Uncertainty: IIT's debated validity necessitates flexibility.
• Ethics: Potential consciousness raises moral considerations.
