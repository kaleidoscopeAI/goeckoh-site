  - New backend endpoints: /mirror/validate (latency p50/p95, GCL mean/min,
    drift p95, gate blocks) and /mirror/reset_metrics to clear telemetry for
    controlled runs.
  - speech_mirror.py adds validation_summary() and reset_metrics();
    telemetry logging remains centralized.
  - Frontend now pulls validation summary, shows p95 latency/GCL mean, and
    offers CSV export; continues sleek, light styling.
