"""Check if the value is Debian's APT-controlled dist-packages.

Debian's ``distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib()`` implementation returns the
default package path controlled by APT, but does not patch ``sysconfig`` to
do the same. This is similar to the bug worked around in ``get_scheme()``,
but here the default is ``deb_system`` instead of ``unix_local``. Ultimately
we can't do anything about this Debian bug, and this detection allows us to
skip the warning when needed.
