   Polyglot Embedding: Unicode 1–4-gram signed hashing (language-agnostic) turns any language into a common vector space.

   Crystallization Loop: Periodic annealing (σ decays) estimates each memory facet’s stability; energetics (H_bits, S_field, L) summarize
   uncertainty/tension.
   Sonification → Attention: Energetics modulate a synthesizer; STFT features go through multi-head projections that “attend” over memory,
   producing captions that reflect what the brain is currently focusing on — no LLMs.

   Concurrent Domain Solvers:

        Math: symbolic evaluation/solve via SymPy.
        Logic/Plan: rule-based planner builds steps.

        Compose: retrieval-augmented synthesizer (pure Python) merges top-K memories and a heuristic explanation.

   Selection: Scores each solver and returns the best result in the same language as your input label (no translation models or APIs).
