- **Parameter Estimation:** Measure engine gains and delay sensitivities empirically in prototype systems to ensure tuning within proven stable regimes.
- **Simulations:** Implement the discrete-time approximations for numerical simulation and validation of stability under realistic noise and delay scenarios.
- **Implementation:** Utilize an actor/event-driven Rust architecture with sharded state and scheduler modules supporting asynchronous execution and rollback.
- **Monitoring:** Develop metrics for continuous stability monitoring and automated parameter adaptation.
