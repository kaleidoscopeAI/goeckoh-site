The first error is about resolving crystal_core. We fix by adjusting the import.

Then there are errors about ChemicalFeatures not having fields like atomic_number, formal_charge, etc.

It seems the definition of ChemicalFeatures has changed. We must update the code that uses these fields.

The errors occur in src/optimizer.rs at lines 434, 482, 483, 484, 485, 509, 510, 511, 512, 633.

We must check what fields are available on ChemicalFeatures and use the available ones.

The note says available fields are: element_symbol, electronegativity, valence_electrons, atomic_radius, is_metal ... and 2 others.

We don't know what the two others are, but they might be formal_charge and hybridization or something else.

Alternatively, the code might be using an old version of the struct.

Since we cannot see the definition of ChemicalFeatures, we must rely on the error message.

The error message says that atomic_number is not a field, so we must remove any code that tries to access it.

Alternatively, if the field has been renamed, we must use the new name.

But without knowing the actual definition, we cannot fix this.

Similarly, errors about AdaptiveCoolingParams not having fields convergence_window, convergence_threshold, etc.

The available fields are: target_acceptance_rate, adjustment_factor, window_size.

So we must update the code that uses the missing fields.

Errors about private fields in Metrics (accuracy, precision, etc.) and then a method exists.

The error suggests using a method instead. So we should change:
