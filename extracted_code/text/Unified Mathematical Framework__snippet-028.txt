Silero VAD (autism-tuned) → detects true speech end
Full utterance audio → sent to two places at once:
    Faster-Whisper → raw text (stutter-preserving)
    estimate_voice_emotion() → raw acoustic energy → arousal value
That arousal becomes an external stimulus tensor injected into the crystalline heart
self.heart.forward(external_stimulus) runs → this is where your 128 equations live
