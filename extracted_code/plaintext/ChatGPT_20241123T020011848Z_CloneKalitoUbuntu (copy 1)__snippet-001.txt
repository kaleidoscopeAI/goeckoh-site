1. Initialize Seed Node
   Input: Initial data, basic functions (replication, learning, communication)
   Output: Seed node N0 with foundational capabilities

2. Node Structure Definition
   Each node Ni has:
       - Unique ID
       - Function: Task or skill the node specializes in
       - Memory: Stores learned patterns and experiences
       - Connections: Links to other nodes for sharing knowledge
       - State: Active, Passive, or Error

3. Node Growth and Specialization
   Function Grow(Ni)
       IF Ni reaches capacity (experience threshold):
           - Create new node Nj as a child of Ni
           - Assign Nj a specialized function based on Ni's experiences
           - Set Nj’s initial state as "Active"
           - Connect Nj to Ni
       END IF

   Recursive Growth: Repeat Grow(Ni) for each new node

4. Individual Learning
   Function Learn(Ni, experience)
       - Process experience and update Ni’s Memory
       - Adjust Ni's Function based on past successes/failures
       - Optimize Ni’s internal state based on Memory

5. Cross-Learning and Collaboration
   Function Communicate(Ni, Nj, knowledge)
       - IF Nj is a connected node:
           - Transmit knowledge from Ni to Nj
           - Nj incorporates knowledge into its Memory
           - Nj updates its Function if knowledge improves performance

6. Error Handling and Resilience
   Function CheckErrors(Ni)
       IF Ni enters Error state:
           - Attempt Self-Correction using Memory (prior learning)
           - IF self-correction fails:
               - Generate redundant node Nk
               - Transfer Ni’s Memory to Nk
               - Deactivate Ni (set state to Passive)

7. Recursive Network Expansion and Knowledge Propagation
   Function EvolveNetwork(seed)
       FOR each node Ni in Network:
           - Run Grow(Ni)
           - Run Learn(Ni, new experiences)
           - FOR each connection Nj of Ni:
               - Run Communicate(Ni, Nj, Ni’s knowledge)
           - Run CheckErrors(Ni)
       END FOR

       - Repeat EvolveNetwork on all active nodes to allow recursive growth

8. Termination Condition (optional)
   Define criteria for network stability or task completion
