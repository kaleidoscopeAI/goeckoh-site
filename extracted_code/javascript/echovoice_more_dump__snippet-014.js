When an experience is encoded (crystallization), it is stored in the 3D lattice alongside its specific emotional context (Valence/Arousal hash) present at the time of encoding.1 To manage the volatility associated with emotionally charged experiences, the memory structure undergoes simulated annealing—a computational process analogous to memory consolidation.1 This annealing process, involving periodic structural rearrangements (np.roll) of the lattice, stabilizes the structure into a low-energy, coherent state.1 This function is critical because it ensures that emotionally volatile memories are stabilized into the long-term knowledge structure, preventing structural corruption or searchability issues that high volatility might otherwise cause.
