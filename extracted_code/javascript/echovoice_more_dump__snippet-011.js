The CQICS framework proposes a unification by suggesting that the functional dynamics described by GWT are deeply intertwined with the structural properties described by IIT. Specifically, the "global workspace" in CQICS is conceptualized not merely as a passive buffer but as a dynamic reflection or manifestation of the most salient and integrated aspects of the underlying maximal Φ-structure identified by IIT principles. The broadcasting mechanism, central to GWT's function, is hypothesized to be a key process that actively contributes to the overall integration (Φ) of the system by facilitating widespread interaction and information sharing among otherwise specialized modules. This creates a dynamic interplay where the system's structure enables function, and function shapes structure over time.
