This modulation serves as an Affective Prioritization mechanism. For example, if the system registers a high positive Valence, the function f(C) increases, causing λbit​ to rise. This intensifies the penalty for bit mismatch in H, driving the annealing process toward achieving stricter symbolic coherence, thereby mathematically reinforcing the positive association with high internal order. Conversely, high Arousal might increase λpos​, physically tightening the spatial clustering of connected nodes and increasing spatial tension, which mathematically corresponds to demanding cognitive attention or Semantic Torque.1
