• Both fields involve learning or adapting parameters based on data.
• Gradient descent and related iterative algorithms are common update mechanisms in both fields.62
• RL can be viewed as a form of adaptive optimal control, seeking policies that maximize long-term rewards.60
• AC typically focuses on real-time performance, stability guarantees, and scenarios with limited data, whereas ML often deals with large datasets and complex function approximation, sometimes offline.62
