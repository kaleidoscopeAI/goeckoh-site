"""
Create a pool key out of a request context dictionary.

According to RFC 3986, both the scheme and host are case-insensitive.
Therefore, this function normalizes both before constructing the pool
key for an HTTPS request. If you wish to change this behaviour, provide
alternate callables to ``key_fn_by_scheme``.

:param key_class:
    The class to use when constructing the key. This should be a namedtuple
    with the ``scheme`` and ``host`` keys at a minimum.
:type  key_class: namedtuple
:param request_context:
    A dictionary-like object that contain the context for a request.
:type  request_context: dict

:return: A namedtuple that can be used as a connection pool key.
:rtype:  PoolKey
