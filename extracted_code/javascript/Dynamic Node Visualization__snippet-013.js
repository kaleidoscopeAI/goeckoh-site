export const dynamicVisualizationService = new DynamicVisualizationService();5.7sExpertwhat about the rest of the system ? the AIs thoughts should be rendering in real time visually. for example only of the ai is researching via web crawl and inhesting the data on the topic of an event then the nodes (18000) of them should be taking form in real time of the subject matter its learning about.like a movie with nodes almost. read the entire document i gave you. its an agi that also visualizes its thoughts etsThought for 39sThe current document provided is a comprehensive JavaScript codebase for the DynamicVisualizationService, which serves as the core visualization engine for an AGI system's thought processes. This service analyzes input text (e.g., conversation or ingested data), extracts semantic context (topics, sentiment, complexity), and generates dynamic 3D node formations using Three.js-compatible structures. The nodes (now expanded to 18,000 as per your specification) form shapes representative of the subject matter, with colors, intensities, and connections modulated by the context. This creates a visual "movie" of the AGI's cognitive evolution—nodes morphing and animating in real-time as the AGI researches, ingests data (e.g., via web crawling), or processes thoughts.
