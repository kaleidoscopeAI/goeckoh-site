I'm now focusing on the specific mathematical tools. I've broken down how to represent the problem of voice cloning as a function mapping linguistic input to acoustic output. This involves disentangling content and style, starting with the foundational Source-Filter theory and MFCCs. I'm moving beyond the initial overview to include deeper dives into the specific math and architecture.
