* **Contraction:** The crawler's output is just another input to the global function `G`. As long as the processed information is bounded (which it is, due to summarization and embedding), the contraction property holds.
* **Stability:** The crawler is activated by internal state (`curiosity tension`) and its output is reintegrated into the state. This forms a closed-loop feedback system. The Lyapunov function can be extended to include the `curiosity tension` state, ensuring the entire system remains stable. The crawl process itself is a stochastic perturbation, which the system is already proven to handle.
