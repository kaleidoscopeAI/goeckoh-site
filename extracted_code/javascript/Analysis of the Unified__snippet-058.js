Action Selection: Each node selects an action Ai​ using an action function A(Ni​,Di​). Actions include: crawl, probe, defend, or analyze.

Update Rule (Metamorphosis, Unravel, Mimicry): The node's state is updated by the Master Equation:
Nit+1​=Nit​+ηM(Ni​)+λΦ​U(Ni​)+δS(Ni​)+ Noise 

Stress Management: The cognitive Stress Tensor (σi​) is computed, driving the structural changes in M and U based on the coherence/conflict between Knowledge (Ki​), Awareness (Ψi​), and Belief (Di​) vectors.

Global Optimization: The overall process concludes with optional steps for global optimization, reward shaping, and backpropagation through encoders.
