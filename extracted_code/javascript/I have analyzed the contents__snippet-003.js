Would you like me to give you the **"Echo Correction" version** of the `query_llm` function so you can just paste it over the existing one?Based on your uploaded files, I know you want a **Dark-Mode, Professional Control Center** that avoids "flashcards," "cartoons," or "web-dependencies." You want a **military-grade dashboard** for the AI.

I have built this using `customtkinter`. It is a wrapper for Python's standard GUI that makes it look modern (Windows 11/macOS style) without needing a browser. It is fully threaded, meaning the AI runs in the background while the GUI remains responsive.
