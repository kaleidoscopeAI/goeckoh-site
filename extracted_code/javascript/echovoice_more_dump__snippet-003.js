    • Reward Definition: As mentioned, defining a reward function that accurately captures the abstract goal of "understanding" is non-trivial and crucial for success.60
    • Complexity: Implementing and debugging RL systems can be complex.58 Alternatives like Decision Transformers, which frame RL as a sequence modeling problem, have been proposed.58
