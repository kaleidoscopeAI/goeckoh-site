    • Reward ((r)): A scalar feedback signal indicating the desirability of the agent's actions or the resulting state. The reward function quantifies the objective of "improving understanding." Designing an effective reward signal is perhaps the most critical and challenging aspect. It could be based on:
        ◦ Prediction accuracy on incoming data.
        ◦ Measures of internal consistency or coherence of the representation within the Cube.
        ◦ Reduction in uncertainty or complexity (entropy).
        ◦ External feedback if available.
