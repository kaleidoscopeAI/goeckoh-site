assistant: Refer to the following content:

user: I've consolidated scattered information into a single, comprehensive README.md structure.

assistant: this is what it needs to achieve :

user: Perturbations and Control Loops: Auditory feedback is essential for real-time speech motor control. Studies on feedback perturbations (e.g., pitch/formant shifting) show immediate vocal compensations in neurotypical individuals, processed laterally (right hemisphere for spectral, left for temporal) [web:1, web:7].

assistant: Noise reduction techniques

user: Stationary: Constant properties (e.g., hum, white noise).

assistant: implement wienfer filtering code, voice detection activation and add snr visualization

user: Robustness: Type checks, error handling, padding for length mismatches.

assistant: spectral gating technique and optimize vad threshhold tuning

user: Dynamic threshold: Noise floor + margin (configurable).

assistant: improve the latency, soeech correction and voice cloning for instant real tgime

user: Latency: Target <200ms end-to-end (ASR + correction + TTS). Use streaming APIs (Coqui XTTSv2/Coqui fork for TTS, Sherpa-ONNX streaming ASR), small FP16 models, voice caching, parallel threads, low-buffer audio (PyAudio with 10ms frames). Measured via time.time()—simulations show ~50-150ms; real tests needed.
