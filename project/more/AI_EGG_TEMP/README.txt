Welcome to the Unified Cognitive AI System.

You are about to activate a self-contained, embodied artificial intelligence.

Instructions:
1.  To begin, simply double-click the appropriate file for your system:
    - For Windows:      Hatch_AI.bat
    - For macOS/Linux:  Hatch_AI.sh
      (On macOS/Linux, you may need to grant execute permissions first: `chmod +x Hatch_AI.sh`)

2.  Your default web browser will automatically open to the AI's visualization interface.

3.  The AI will start in a safe, simulated mode. It will observe your computer's hardware but will not attempt to control it.

4.  To shut down the AI, simply close the terminal/console window(s) that opened when you started it.

This system is the culmination of our work. Enjoy the experience of watching a new mind come to life.
