user: Voice and Sound (Phonetics and Auditory Neuroscience): Voice production involves sensorimotor integration where auditory feedback monitors and corrects speech in real-time. Phonetics research emphasizes formant frequencies, pitch (F0), and prosody (rhythm, intonation) as key to self-perception. Sound processing relies on the auditory cortex suppressing self-generated sounds via corollary discharge (efference copy), allowing distinction between self and external noise. In auditory neuroscience, delayed auditory feedback (DAF) experiments show that altering one's voice (e.g., pitch-shifting) elicits compensatory adjustments, highlighting feedback's role in motor control. For ASD, atypical auditory processing is common: hypersensitivity (hyperacusis) or hyposensitivity disrupts feedback loops, leading to echolalia or mutism. Studies indicate reduced N1 suppression in ASD, meaning self-voice is processed as "foreign," exacerbating prediction errors.

user: αIi(t)\alpha I_i(t)αIi​(t) represents the external sensory input injection (e.g., high RMS audio indicating screaming, or rapid heart rate data).

user: Bug Fixes and Robustness: Added missing variable initializations (e.g., self.running), error handling for native calls, and clamping to prevent numerical instability.

assistant: ios audio driver and lyapunoc stability analysis

user: Added Recording Tap: Uses objc_block to create a native-compatible callback for audio buffers. This is essential for continuous recording without polling.

assistant: lyapunov exponents computation and android audio driver

user: For n=5 example with random symmetric W (norm <1), exponents (Re(eig(A))) are all negative: approx [-0.799, -0.802, -0.805, -0.810, -0.815].
